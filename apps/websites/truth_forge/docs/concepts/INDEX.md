## Overview

These concepts are essential for understanding the website's foundation. They explain the Framework, the Grammar, Stage 5 minds, and core patterns that shape everything we build.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Framework
**Document**: [THE_FRAMEWORK.md](THE_FRAMEWORK.md)  
**Purpose**: Complete cognitive architecture that bridges ME and NOT-ME

**Key Points**:
- Three layers: Theory → Meta → Specifics → Code
- Numbered sequence (00-09) with ALPHA:OMEGA loop
- Universal pattern: HOLD:AGENT:HOLD

---

### 2. The Grammar
**Document**: [THE_GRAMMAR.md](THE_GRAMMAR.md)  
**Purpose**: Naming conventions that encode identity

**Key Points**:
- Grammar is ontology (how something is written tells you what it IS)
- Three marks: colon (ME), hyphen (US), underscore (NOT-ME)
- The descent: Principle → Product → Implementation

---

### 3. Stage 5 Minds
**Document**: [STAGE_5_MINDS.md](STAGE_5_MINDS.md)  
**Purpose**: Cognitive model the framework serves

**Key Points**:
- Stage 5 is the floor, not the ceiling
- Can hold multiple, contradictory systems
- Loyal to Truth, not ideology

---

### 4. HOLD:AGENT:HOLD
**Document**: [HOLD_AGENT_HOLD.md](HOLD_AGENT_HOLD.md)  
**Purpose**: Universal pattern for all work

**Key Points**:
- One pattern, everywhere, same at every scale
- HOLD (rest) → AGENT (work) → HOLD (rest)
- Systems connect at HOLDs, never at AGENTs

---

### 5. TRUTH:MEANING:CARE
**Document**: [TRUTH_MEANING_CARE.md](TRUTH_MEANING_CARE.md)  
**Purpose**: The Furnace - metabolic process

**Key Points**:
- TRUTH (fuel) → MEANING (fire) → CARE (work)
- The only valid output is CARE
- Knowledge without care is ash
