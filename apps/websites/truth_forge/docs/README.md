## Document Strategy

### Copied Documents

These documents are copied from main `docs/` with website context:

- **Framework Concepts**: From `docs/research/library/concepts/`
- **Design Standards**: From `docs/business/branding/`
- **Brand Identity**: From `docs/business/branding/one/TRUTH_FORGE.md`

### Linked Documents

These documents link to main `docs/` for advanced concepts:

- **Research Concepts**: Link to `docs/research/library/concepts/`
- **Advanced Systems**: Link to main documentation

---

## Key Principles

1. **Everything on the website is documented here**
2. **Core concepts copied for easy access**
3. **Research concepts linked to main docs**
4. **Design system centralized**
5. **Standards ensure consistency**

---

## Maintenance

- **Update when**: Website evolves, new features added
- **Sync strategy**: Core concepts copied, research linked
- **Source of truth**: Main `docs/` folder is canonical
- **Website team**: Maintains website-specific docs

---

*This documentation ensures consistency as we build out the Truth Forge website and related apps.*
