## When to Use Research Concepts

**Use for**:
- Deep understanding of systems
- Technical implementation details
- Research and development
- Advanced feature development

**Don't use for**:
- Basic website content (use `docs/concepts/` instead)
- Design decisions (use `docs/design/` instead)
- Component development (use `docs/standards/` instead)
