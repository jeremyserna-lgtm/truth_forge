# Archive: 2026-01-27 Consolidation - Status Files

**Date**: 2026-01-27  
**Purpose**: Consolidated duplicate status files

---

## Contents

This archive contains status files that were superseded by more recent comprehensive status documents.

**Total Files**: Multiple status files (exact count in directory)

---

## Rationale

Multiple status files existed with overlapping information. The most recent comprehensive status document was kept, and older status files were:
1. ✅ Deprecated with headers
2. ✅ Moved to local archive
3. ✅ Uploaded to GCS bucket `gs://truth-engine-archive/`
4. ✅ Removed from source locations (no redirect stubs)

---

## GCS Location

All files are available in:
```
gs://truth-engine-archive/pipelines/adapters/claude_code/reports/archive/2026_01_27_consolidation/status_files/
```

*Archive created during pipeline document consolidation.*
