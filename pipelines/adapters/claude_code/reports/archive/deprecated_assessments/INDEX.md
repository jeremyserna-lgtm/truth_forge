# Deprecated Assessment Reports Archive

**Date**: 2026-01-27

This directory contains archived assessment reports that have been superseded by canonical compliance reports.

## Archived Reports

All assessment reports have been moved here and replaced with canonical compliance reports in each stage directory:
- `scripts/stage_N/COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`

## Why Archived

- Multiple assessment reports existed for the same stage
- Reports were inconsistent in format and content
- Canonical reports provide standardized 100% compliance certification

## Current Reports

See canonical compliance reports in:
- `scripts/stage_0/COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`
- `scripts/stage_1/COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`
- ... (one per stage)
