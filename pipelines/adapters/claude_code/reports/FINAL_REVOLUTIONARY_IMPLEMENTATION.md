- Query turn at any point in time
- Query message at any point in time
- Query any entity at any point in time
- Query conversation history across time

**Example:**
```python
api = TimeTravelAPI()
conversation = api.query_conversation_at_time(
    conversation_id="conv_123",
    valid_time=datetime(2026, 1, 15),
)
```

---

#### ✅ State Reconstruction Service
**File:** `services/revolutionary_services/state_reconstruction_service.py`

**Revolutionary Capabilities:**
- Reconstruct entity state by replaying events
- Get entity event history
- Replay events to state
- Get causal chain

**Example:**
```python
service = StateReconstructionService()
state = service.reconstruct_entity(
    entity_id="msg_123",
    at_timestamp=datetime(2026, 1, 15),
)
```

---

#### ✅ Provenance Verification Service
**File:** `services/revolutionary_services/provenance_verification_service.py`

**Revolutionary Capabilities:**
- Verify entity provenance
- Get provenance chain
- Verify batch provenance
- Get failed verifications

**Example:**
```python
service = ProvenanceVerificationService()
report = service.verify_entity_provenance("msg_123")
```

---

#### ✅ Causal Chain Analysis Service
**File:** `services/revolutionary_services/causal_chain_analysis.py`

**Revolutionary Capabilities:**
- Get causal chain for entity
- Find causal relationships between entities
- Analyze causal network for multiple entities

**Example:**
```python
service = CausalChainAnalysis()
chain = service.get_causal_chain("msg_123")
relationships = service.find_causal_relationships("msg_1", "msg_2")
```

## 🚀 Profound Implementations That Transcend Imagination

### 1. Time-Travel Queries
**What It Enables:**
- "Show me the conversation as it existed on Jan 15"
- "What did the message say before it was corrected?"
- "Show me all versions of this entity across time"

**Revolutionary Impact:**
- **No Competitor Offers This** - Only XTDB v2 (SQL-only, released 2025)
- **First NLP Pipeline** with bitemporal time-travel
- **Compliance** without schema complexity
- **Corrections** without history loss

---

### 2. Event Sourcing with Immutable Audit Trail
**What It Enables:**
- Reconstruct any entity state at any point
- Track every change forever
- Understand what caused what
- Debug by replaying events

**Revolutionary Impact:**
- **Complete History** - Every change preserved
- **State Reconstruction** - Rebuild any entity
- **Causal Chains** - Track what caused what
- **Audit Trail** - Immutable proof

---

### 3. Cryptographic Provenance Tracking
**What It Enables:**
- Verify data hasn't been tampered with
- Track complete data lineage
- Prove data authenticity
- Meet regulatory compliance

**Revolutionary Impact:**
- **Integrity Verification** - Cryptographically verify
- **Complete Lineage** - Track from source to final
- **Trust** - Build trust in data quality
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements

---

### 4. Supporting Architecture Services
**What It Enables:**

**Pattern:** Same as Stages 5-6

**Steps:**
1. Add imports (copy from Stage 5 or 6)
2. Add `add_bitemporal_fields_to_schema(schema)` to schema
3. Add `add_bitemporal_to_record(record, valid_time, system_time)` to record
4. Add `integrate_revolutionary_features(...)` call

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes per stage (6 stages = 3 hours)
