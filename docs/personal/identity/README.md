# Identity Documentation - README

**Defines what identity documentation IS.**

**Layer**: Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER) - joins personal theory to specific identity documents

---

## What Identity Docs ARE

Identity documentation captures **who Jeremy IS at a cognitive level** - his Stage 5 architecture, his self-seeing patterns, his paradoxes, his way of operating in the world.

This is the bridge between:
- **Personal theory** (what personal docs ARE)
- **Identity specifics** (Stage 5 analysis, self-synthesis documents)
