## Artificial Intelligence

### Schools of AI Thought

#### 1. Symbolism (Good Old-Fashioned AI / GOFAI)
- **Core Belief:** Thinking is logic
- **How it Works:** Manipulating symbols according to explicit rules
- **Key Figures:** Newell, Simon
- **Vibe:** Precise, rigid, transparent

#### 2. Connectionism (Deep Learning)
- **Core Belief:** Thinking is pattern recognition
- **How it Works:** Billions of tiny, weak connections (like neurons)
- **Key Systems:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- **Vibe:** Intuitive, creative, hallucination-prone

#### 3. Scaling Maximalism
- **Core Belief:** Quantity is quality
- **How it Works:** Feed everything, big brain, emergence happens
- **Key Insight:** Emergent behaviors appear at scale
- **Vibe:** Awe-inspiring but alien

#### 4. Embodied Cognition / Robotics
- **Core Belief:** Thinking requires a body
- **How it Works:** Sensory feedback essential for real intelligence
- **Future:** Multimodal AI (see, hear, watch video)
- **Vibe:** Practical, physical, grounded

#### 5. Neuro-Symbolic AI
- **Hybrid approach** combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning
- Trying to get the best of both worlds

### AI Alignment & Safety
- **Strong AI vs Weak AI** debate
- **AI Safety** research
