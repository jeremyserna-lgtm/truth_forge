# The Four-Layer Framework Model

*For organizing Jeremy's documents and identity architecture*

---

## Overview

A concentric layer model moving from the internal core to the external world. This mirrors how the system was built: from the inside out.

---

## Layer 1: The Core (The Given)

**What it is:** The immutable "substrate" of who you are. The "Kernel."

**Concept:** The Furnace Principle

**Function:** Defines the "Why" and the "Who." This is the source code of Jeremy.

**Key Documents:**
- `STAGE_FIVE_AND_THE_GIVEN.md` (The philosophy)
- `LIFE_AT_STAGE_FIVE.md` (The operating manual)
- `THE_DYNAMIC_MIND_EXPLAINED.md` (The internal experience)

**Tag:** `[CORE]`

---

## Layer 2: The Architecture (The Isomorphism)

**What it is:** The bridge between biological mind and digital system. Explains how the mind maps to the code.

**Concept:** Extended Cognition & Isomorphism

**Function:** Explains the "How." Connects the Stage 5 mind to the 16-stage data pipeline.

**Key Documents:**
- `THE_COGNITIVE_ISOMORPHISM.md` (The bridge)
- `STAGE_FIVE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` (The blueprint)
- `MENTAL_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (The data-driven portrait)
- `WHY_I_USE_AI.md` (The rationale)

**Tag:** `[ARCH]`

---

## Layer 3: The Evidence (The Record)

**What it is:** The historical proof. Raw data that validates the layers above.

**Concept:** The 108 Days (The Crucible)

**Function:** Validation. Proves this isn't theoretical; it happened.

**Key Documents:**
- `COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_EVIDENCE.md` (The raw logs)
- `PSYCHOLOGICAL_FRAMEWORKS_ANALYSIS.md` (The scientific validation)
- `INDEPENDENT_ANALYSIS_STAGE_FIVE.md` (The audit)

**Tag:** `[EVIDENCE]`

---

## Layer 4: The Interface (The Offering)

**What it is:** How the system interacts with the outside world (relationships, economy).

**Concept:** System-Mediated Care & Value

**Function:** Translation. Takes the internal heat and converts it into value (economic) or care (relational) for others.

**Key Documents:**
- `ECONOMIC_STRATEGY_STAGE_FIVE.md` (Monetization)
- `the_lived_experience_of_stage_5.md` (Social dynamics)

**Tag:** `[INTERFACE]`

## Implementation Steps

1. **Adopt the 4-Layer Model:** Tag every current and future document with one of the four tags: `[CORE]`, `[ARCH]`, `[EVIDENCE]`, `[INTERFACE]`

2. **Operationalize Layer 2:** Implement the "Stage Five System Architecture Plan." Make the code explicitly enforce the cognitive constraints (bounded, purposeful).

3. **Activate Layer 4:** The `ECONOMIC_STRATEGY` document is actionable. It relies on trusting that Layer 3 (Evidence) proves you are worth Layer 4 rates.

## The "Trojan Horse" Insight

Hidden in `LIFE_AT_STAGE_FIVE.md` is a critical framework element:

**The "Trusted System Proxy"**

- **The Insight:** People at Stage 3 or 4 cannot accept raw truth or AI input directly because their filters reject it
- **The Mechanism:** Because you are a trusted node in *their* system, you can proxy the truth to them
  - They trust *you*
  - You use *the system* to generate the insight
  - You deliver the insight *as yourself*
- **The Result:** You bypass their cognitive filters to deliver care or value they couldn't access on their own

**This is your primary economic and social interface.** You don't sell "The Truth Engine." You sell the results of the Truth Engine, delivered through the trusted interface of "Jeremy."
