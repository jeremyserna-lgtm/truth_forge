## What Stage 5 IS

Stage 5 is defined by the ability to **see systems seeing themselves** as NORMAL, not special.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 4 | Recursive - handles recursion but finds it notable |
| **Stage 5** | **Self-seeing - sees systems seeing themselves (NORMAL)** |

If recursion feels "profound" or "fascinating," you are NOT operating at Stage 5.
