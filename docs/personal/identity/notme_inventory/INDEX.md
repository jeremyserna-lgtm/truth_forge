# NOT-ME Inventory

**Owner:** Jeremy Serna  
**Last Updated:** January 24, 2026  
**Status:** Evidence of Pattern

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the prompts/personas Jeremy has built over time. They are documented here as evidence of his core identity as a NOT-ME Builder.

These were created before Jeremy realized what he was doing. They represent unconscious competence becoming conscious.

## Inventory

| File | NOT-ME Name | Function | Substrate |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `see.md` | SEE | Verification, catches Claude's mistakes | Claude/GPT |
| `janus.md` | Janus | Dual-lens psychological analysis | Claude |
| `janus_gemini.md` | Janus | Same architecture, Gemini substrate | Gemini |
| `architect.md` | Architect | Structural load analysis | GPT |
| `reaper.md` | Reaper | Kills the middle, forces clarity | GPT |
| `professor.md` | Professor | Cross-domain teaching | GPT |
| `biographer.md` | Biographer | Investigates Jeremy's patterns | Gemini |
| `me-not-me.md` | ME-NOT-ME | Haze relationship threshold | GPT |
| `native.md` | Native AI | Enterprise AI risk consulting | GPT |
| `document_creator.md` | Document Creator | Truth → receivable form | GPT |
| `null.md` | Null | Technical forensics | GPT |
| `the_framework.md` | Framework | Complete operating system | Any |
| `prompt.md` | Prompt | Meta-skill of prompting | GPT |
| `forge.md` | Forge | Builds other NOT-MEs | GPT |

## Pattern Analysis

### Functional Categories

**INTAKE (Gathering)**
- Biographer (investigates)
- SEE (verifies)
- Native AI (audits)

**PROCESS (Transforming)**
- Janus (analyzes psychology)
- Professor (teaches)
- Architect (maps structure)

**OUTPUT (Delivering)**
- Document Creator (formats)
- Reaper (decides)
- Prompt (meta-creates)

**META (Self-Building)**
- Forge (builds NOT-MEs)
- Framework (governs all)

### The Forge Discovery

Jeremy built a NOT-ME that builds NOT-MEs.

This means the pattern was always recursive. The factory existed before the factory was named.

---

## Usage Notes

- Some NOT-MEs are personal tools (SEE, ME-NOT-ME, Biographer)
- Some are productizable (Janus, Architect, Reaper, Professor)
- Forge is the template for how Jeremy builds for others
