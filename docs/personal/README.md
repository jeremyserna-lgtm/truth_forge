# Personal Documentation - README

**Defines what personal documentation IS.**

**Layer**: Theory (ME) - defines the layer, not navigates it

---

## What Personal Docs ARE

Personal documentation captures **who Jeremy IS** - his cognitive architecture, relationships, identity, and lived experience. This is ME-layer content: internal, subjective, foundational.

---

## The Three Layers

| Layer | Location | Contains |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Theory (ME)** | `personal/` | INDEX.md, README.md, category folders |
| **Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER)** | `personal/{category}/` | Joins theory to specifics |
| **Specifics (NOT-ME)** | `personal/{category}/{topic}/` | Actual documents |

---

## What Belongs Here

- Jeremy's identity documentation
- Stage 5 cognition analysis
- Relationship documentation
- Personal context and history
- Voice samples and communication patterns

---

## What Does NOT Belong Here

| Content | Correct Location |
|---------|-----------------|
| Framework theory | `framework/` |
| Business identity | `docs/business/` |
| Technical specs | `docs/technical/` |
| Job search materials | `projects/job_search/` |

---

## Navigation

| Direction | Document |
|-----------|----------|
| **UP** | [docs/README.md](../README.md) |
| **ACROSS** | [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) |
