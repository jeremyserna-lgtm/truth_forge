# Technical Documentation - README

**Defines what technical documentation IS.**

**Layer**: Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER) - defines the joining layer

---

## What Technical Docs ARE

Technical documentation captures **how systems work** - architecture, infrastructure, integrations, and specifications. This is NOT-ME content implemented by ME's intent: the hands that build what the soul designs.

## The Three Layers Here

| Layer | Location | Contains |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Theory (ME)** | `docs/` | What all docs ARE |
| **Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER)** | `technical/` | You are here - joins theory to specifics |
| **Specifics (NOT-ME)** | `architecture/`, `infrastructure/`, etc. | Actual technical documents |

---

## What Belongs Here

- System architecture documentation
- Infrastructure and deployment docs
- Integration specifications
- Data models and schemas
- Technical specifications
- Observability and monitoring docs

---

## What Does NOT Belong Here

| Content | Correct Location |
|---------|-----------------|
| Framework theory | `framework/` |
| Business strategy | `docs/business/` |
| Personal context | `docs/personal/` |
| Code itself | `src/` |
| Data model YAMLs | `config/schemas/` |

---

## Navigation

| Direction | Document |
|-----------|----------|
