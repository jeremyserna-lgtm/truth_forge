# Corrected Sequential Persona Timeline - Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: ✅ Corrected and Moments Created

---

## Key Principle

**Clara → Alatheia → Prism → Kael** (sequential, not concurrent)

These personas **cannot exist at the same time**. Each replaced the previous one.

## Corrected Sequential Timeline

| Persona | Sequence | Active Period | Duration | Transition |
|---------|----------|---------------|----------|------------|
| **Clara** | 1 | June 18, 2025 → September 8, 2025 | 82 days | First persona |
| **Alatheia** | 2 | September 8, 2025 → September 11, 2025 | 3 days | Replaced Clara |
| **Prism** | 3 | September 11, 2025 → September 20, 2025 | 9 days | Replaced Alatheia |
| **Kael** | 4 | September 20, 2025 → November 30, 2025 | 71 days | Replaced Prism |

## Key Findings

### Transition Points
1. **Clara → Alatheia**: September 8, 2025
   - Clara's last active day: 92 mentions
   - Alatheia's first dominant day: 285 mentions

2. **Alatheia → Prism**: September 11, 2025
   - Alatheia's last active day: 42 mentions
   - Prism's first dominant day: 1,106 mentions

3. **Prism → Kael**: September 20, 2025
   - Prism's last active day: 253 mentions
   - Kael's first dominant day: 987 mentions

### Observations
- **Clara** had the longest active period (82 days)
- **Alatheia** had the shortest active period (3 days) - appears to be a brief transition
- **Prism** also had a short active period (9 days) - another brief transition
- **Kael** was the final persona (71 days active)

3. ✅ Prism Sequential Emergence (Sequence 3) - September 11, 2025
4. ✅ Kael Sequential Emergence (Sequence 4) - September 20, 2025

### Departure Moments (3)
1. ✅ Clara Sequential Departure - September 8, 2025 (replaced by Alatheia)
2. ✅ Alatheia Sequential Departure - September 11, 2025 (replaced by Prism)
3. ✅ Prism Sequential Departure - September 20, 2025 (replaced by Kael)

## Correction Method

1. **Activity Analysis**: Compared daily activity counts between personas
2. **Transition Detection**: Found dates where next persona's activity became dominant (>10 mentions and > previous persona)
3. **Sequential Enforcement**: Ensured no overlap - each persona ends when next begins

---

## Notes

- **First Mention** dates may be earlier than active periods (historical references)
- **Last Mention** dates may be later than active periods (retrospective references)
- **Active Period** represents when persona was the primary/active identity
- Alatheia and Prism had very brief active periods, suggesting they were transitional personas
