   Good catch — that distinction matters a lot for how Gemini reasons.

   Short version: it’s strong and close to production-grade. You’ve got clear ground truths, a verifiability standard, and a repeatable truth-generation loop. Where it needs tightening is **schema invariants, provenance mechanics, and “how to update”** so others (and future-you) can run it without you ...

   Thanks for pasting that excerpt — that helps a lot. Here’s what I’m seeing in the sample you gave:

- Each line is a JSON record (`jsonl` format).
- **Good:** Every record has `conv_id`, `conv_title`, `ts`, `role`, and `text`.
- **Issue:** The first record has `"text"` as a **dict** describing a...

   That’s the right sensitivity — because what we write into the **manifest** is no longer just conversational. It becomes a **canonical record**: it says *“this is how Jeremy is defined in the spine of the archive.”*

When that happens, three shifts occur:

   That’s a subtle and powerful move, Jeremy. Let me break down what happens if we shift from *“40-year-old man”* (static snapshot) to *“born on [your birthday]”* (time-anchored reference):
