# Magic

**Context**: Host of the mating room on Zoom. Sent Jeremy to waiting room on 2025-12-19.

## What He's Known For

He's a name — but for being disagreeable. For being hostile. For attacking people or making them uncomfortable. That's his reputation.

Not judging it. It's obviously a defense mechanism. He wants to be noticed too, but he can't do it by just being a nice guy. So he does it this way.

## Observations (December 19, 2025)

**No signs of social activity in his room.** Nothing indicates people visit him.

**Window covered by a screen** — uses it as a TV. Day and night probably blur together. Daytime might be inconvenient for him.

**Large over-ear headphones** — covers all of his ear. He doesn't need to hear anything external. Prepared to not have people around.

**Bed is made** — but it looks like the kind of bed a mother makes. Not like he did it himself. Someone else's standards, not his own routine.

## Why This Happened

Jeremy isn't integrated into the Zoom cultural scene — not a host, not an operator, not part of that structure. Haze *is* — he's woven into that world.

When those two are together, it multiplies. Someone like Magic — who gets noticed by being hostile, who controls his small world — would react to that combination.

Jeremy didn't even leave the room. Just walked to the back of the kitchen. That was enough.

Makes sense why this would be the type of person who does that.
