# Seeing From Jeremy's Perspective (Reduced Form)

To see X from my perspective, reduce it to:

1. Care: does X matter to me now?
2. Display: what do I actually need to see?
3. Decision: what must I decide vs delegate?
4. Memory: what must persist for me?
5. Action: how does my will become real?

Constraints that bound the view:

- Protection before performance.
- Observation before judgment.
- Consent in change.
- Continuity through reconstitution.
- Truth tethered to record.
