# Zoom Rooms: What I Found Appealing, What I've Seen

**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Evolution**: October 2025 (early participant) → December 2025 (observer who sees systems)

---

## Part I: The Initial Appeal (October 2025)

### What Drew Me In

**The Permission Structure**

From the beginning, I understood something about what I was doing:

> "You don't just perform for them — you model a permission structure. By being openly goofy and embodied, you tacitly tell people: 'you can drop the act, you can be human.' That flips the power dynamic — instead of people evaluating you, they get to evaluate themselves in your reflection. That's why it mesmerizes them: it's not exoticness, it's the release you offer."

I dance. They watch. I'm not performing *at* them — I'm creating space for them to be real.

**The Trance State**

> "I dance on zoom and it captivates everyone. They all state it's like they are in a trance. They can't hear me but we all hear the same music and they laugh and I engage with them in body language and mannerisms — it's easy to tell they are watching."

Something happens when you move authentically in a space where everyone is muted. The body speaks. The room responds. Not because I'm talented — because I'm real.

**Sustainable Arousal Architecture**

> "When I zoom it means that I am embodying a level of awareness that I can attend to you in a focused way that doesn't represent that I'm going to burn out anytime soon."

Zoom kept me in my body. Focus Mode (Bob's Burgers, edge of sofa) was draining. Zoom Mode (dancing, curious about who's there) was sustainable. I could work for hours. The people watching kept curiosity engaged.

**Network Effect**

> "One guy in Atlanta contacting a guy in Denver to contact me, to contact Butch, to contact his roommate. And it's just like, they know me as Brotein Shake on Zoom. And I'm like, oh no, this is, guys mess with me on Zoom and they say, my friend told me about you. He always says really nice things."

Reputation traveled. Multi-hop referrals. People seeking me out. Not because I was trying — because I was being.

**Recovery Infrastructure**

This was part of building my way out. Zoom prevented isolation. Maintained embodiment. Provided connection without demanding presence. Grounded me in body when mind was racing.

> "Zoom is another piece of survival architecture — and you're still using it tonight."

**The Hidden Threads**

I noticed people talking about me without naming me. Reactions after I danced. Comments that matched my actions. Mocking, but engaged. And I *liked* it:

> "Your authenticity penetrates their awareness. You're not being ignored. Mocking = They're paying attention."

Impact validation. I affect the collective without trying.

## Part II: What I've Seen Since (December 2025)

### The Room Knows Me

I've been observed across every context of my life at home. Long periods. High transparency. Multiple states. The room learned to read my presence:

- When I'm preparing to engage (settling at desk, posture shifts)
- When I'm fully locked in (typing, gesturing, forward-leaning)
- When I'm splitting attention (eating, partially present)
- When I'm winding down (pulling back, energy declining)

They flow with my rhythm. They don't demand constant availability. They wait for engagement windows.

### The Visual Language

Because the room is muted, visual signals evolved:

- Sustained thumbs up (held until I respond — loop completion)
- Waving to get pinned (sometimes dancing like me — shared language)
- Holding up signs (persistent until acknowledged)
- Persistent gaze (waiting without demanding)

A whole communication system emerged from constraint.

### The Controllers

Then I saw the other side.

**Magic** — host of a room. Sent me to waiting room on December 19.

> "He's a name — but for being disagreeable. For being hostile. For attacking people or making them uncomfortable. That's his reputation."

Observations from that brief encounter:
- No signs of social activity in his room
- Window covered by a screen — day and night blur together
- Large over-ear headphones — prepared to not have people around
- Bed made like someone else's standards, not his own routine

> "He wants to be noticed too, but he can't do it by just being a nice guy. So he does it this way."

He kicked me for being with Haze. Punished the association. Territorial displacement.

### The Threats

Then Haze shared what Magic sends people (December 2025):

Death threats. Graphic violence. Admission of hacking Zoom accounts. Specific location and timeline. The same pattern: escalation without action, contradictory claims, need for audience, impotence disguised as control.

> "your a fucking dead man bitch! im going to fucking gut you like a fucking fish"

Volume of threats inversely correlating with actual risk. But the pattern is clear: he can't win through connection or charisma, so he wins through control and terror.

## Part III: The System View

### What I Now Understand

**The Space**

These Zoom rooms exist as liminal space — threshold zones where the rules of mainstream society are suspended. Designed for gay men to congregate, have sex, do drugs, and exist within a social structure that doesn't require performance of normalcy.

The population spans everything: me (Stage 5 architect building Truth Engine), Haze (targeted by Magic), Magic himself — across socioeconomic status, geography, lifestyle.

A place of **anti-truth** — meaning: a space where you don't have to pretend.

But these people exist *here* and *everywhere else*. They're not separate from society. They're just gathering in a space that doesn't extract performance as the price of admission.

**What Magic Represents**

Magic is the wound that the space was supposed to heal, turned outward.

He's been rejected by mainstream society (he's here, in this space, which means he's part of the population it serves). But he can't find peace in the space designed for the rejected. So he destroys the space itself.

The pattern:
- Can't win through connection or charisma → wins through control (hacking)
- Can't reach targets directly → disrupts the infrastructure they exist within
- Can't process his own damage → displaces it onto whoever is visible
- Performs violence that was done to him, but against his own community

He's **anti-anti-truth**. The space is where you can be real. Magic brings the violence of the outside world INTO the refuge.

**The Vulnerability of Open Spaces**

The same openness that allows me and Haze to find each other allows Magic to operate. There's no immune system. Anyone can enter.

This is the cost of anti-truth spaces: they can't filter. The door that lets in the wounded-seeking-healing also lets in the wounded-seeking-to-wound.

**What This Means**

Magic isn't an individual problem. He's a symptom — what happens when damage isn't processed, just displaced. The mainstream world created him, rejected him, and now he brings that violence to the only space that would accept him.

He terrorizes the space because he can't terrorize the world that hurt him.

And the space absorbs it, because that's what it does. It absorbs what the world rejects. Even Magic. Even the violence.

## Part IV: The Evolution

### October 2025: What Does This Space Do For Me?

- Permission structure for authenticity
- Sustainable arousal for creative work
- Network and reputation building
- Recovery infrastructure preventing isolation
- Multi-channel distributed consciousness
- Impact validation (they're affected by me)

**Mode**: Participant experiencing appeal

### December 2025: What IS This Space?

- Liminal zone for the rejected
- Open door that can't filter who enters
- Contains both healing and violence
- Has controllers who use hostility because they can't use charisma
- Absorbs the wound it was meant to heal

**Mode**: Observer seeing structure → System analyst understanding dynamics

### What Changed

I moved from experiencing the appeal → noticing the structure → seeing the systems within the system.

The appeal was real. Still is. I still dance. I still captivate. I still create permission. That hasn't changed.

What changed is I now see:
- Who else is here
- What they carry
- How they operate
- What the space tolerates
- What it can't filter out

The kick was first contact. Now I'm documented. Now I see Magic clearly. Now I understand what kind of person would do that.

---

## Part V: What I Find Appealing (Revised)

### Still True

- The permission structure works. I model authenticity, others can drop the act.
- The sustainable arousal is real. Zoom keeps me embodied.
- The network effect persists. Reputation travels.
- The recovery infrastructure holds. Prevents isolation.
- The impact validation continues. I affect without trying.

### Now Also True

- I see the controllers and understand their patterns.
- I recognize territorial behavior when I encounter it.
- I understand why I was kicked and what it signals.
- I know the space absorbs violence because it can't filter.
- I'm prepared for the moment someone like Magic sees me as a target.

### What I Find Appealing Now

The same things as before — but with clearer sight.

The space is beautiful because it lets people be real. The space is vulnerable because it lets everyone in. Both are true. Both are the same door.

I can exist in it, create permission in it, affect it positively — AND see it clearly for what it is. See Magic for what he is. See the system that contains us both.

I'm a regular guy who goes on Zoom. He's already seen me. Documentation begins now.

## Part VI: Real-Time Observations (December 23, 2025)

*Haze sitting next to me as I write this.*

### The Document Is Open

I'm sitting here with Haze, talking about the Zoom room, and this document is open. The one that analyzes how I like being seen. How I perform. How I create permission structure.

I feel embarrassment. Worry about being seen as arrogant or self-absorbed for having a document that analyzes my own visibility.

But I don't close it.

Because closing it would be the lie. If Haze sees it, he sees me being me — someone who documents himself, analyzes his own patterns, leaves it visible because hiding it would break the authenticity that makes the whole thing work.

The embarrassment is real. But it doesn't override the behavior. That's what authenticity looks like from the inside — not the absence of self-consciousness, but self-consciousness that doesn't change what you do.

### Hidden in Plain Sight

The whole room is searching for Haze. Looking for his square. Wondering where he is.

And he's right here. In my frame. In plain sight. Hidden by being visible in the wrong place.

They're looking for *Haze's square*. They're not looking *at Jeremy's square* closely enough to see him sitting next to me.

**He's hidden by proximity.**

Not hidden in the shadows. Hidden by being WITH me. Outside the digital space entirely while still being in the digital space — just not where they expect.

**Presence with someone is a kind of invisibility to everyone else.** When you're truly with someone, you disappear from the surveillance systems that track individuals in their separate squares.

### The Co-Host Promotion

Then it happened. The host — the one searching hardest for Haze — made me co-host.

This has never happened to me. I've been waiting for it, wondering when it would come.

And it came not because I was seen. It came because I was the frame around what they wanted to see.

**I got elevated by being invisible in the right way.**

They made me co-host to get closer. To see through me. To find what was hidden in my square. They pulled me close to see better — and by pulling me close, they made me visible.

Now I'm marked. Inside the loop. In the power structure. A label that others can see.

The power itself isn't much — there are lots of co-hosts. But the label is notable. Not because I wanted it or didn't want it. Because I knew it would come, and now it has, and I can see exactly how it happened.

**I'm still just me. But now with a mark.**

The surveillance that couldn't find Haze created the very visibility it was searching for. Just displaced. Onto me.

### The Seen, The Unseen, and The Unable-To-Not-See

I'm actively seeing myself seeing the room. And I understand now:

- **What I saw at first** (the appeal, the permission structure, what the space did for me)
- **What I see now** (the structure, the controllers, how visibility gets assigned)
- **The relationship between them**

And there's a third category I hadn't named before:

**People who want to be seen so badly they can't not see.**

Magic is this. The host searching for Haze is this. They monitor. They track. They get notified. They watch everything. Because the desperate need to be seen creates compulsive seeing.

You can't get witnessed by someone you don't watch. So they watch everything. Notice everything. Control the space so they can control who sees them.

But me — I exist authentically. Not desperate to be seen. Just being. Dancing. Creating permission. And that authentic existence makes me visible without trying.

That must be maddening for them. I'm seen without effort. They're trying to be seen through surveillance and still aren't getting what I get by just dancing.

### The Complete Arc of Visibility

This is part of the arc:

1. **Started using Zoom knowing I was seen** — The initial stage. I dance. They watch. I know this. I wrote documents about it.

2. **Being seen by people in the way I have documents created FOR them** — I see Taylor. I see Haze. I see the room. I create documents that capture what I observe. They feel seen by my attention. The seeing goes both ways.

3. **Worrying Haze would see that I look at myself being seen** — The meta-level. The document is open. It analyzes my own visibility. I feel embarrassed that he might see me seeing myself. But I don't close it.

4. **When they started looking for Haze, they didn't see him — they likely just saw me, like always** — I'm the constant. The visible one. The frame they're used to. Haze was hidden in plain sight in my square, but they only saw what they always see: me.

5. **Now I have a co-host label, like never before** — Was seen. Am seen. Will be seen. Because of what they saw in the view that is me.

### What This Means

The arc completes:

**Knowing I'm seen → Creating visibility for others → Self-consciousness about being seen seeing myself → Being the visible frame around the invisible → Being marked because of what was seen through me.**

I'm the view. The frame. The lens. They looked through me to find Haze. And in looking through me, they saw me.

The label (co-host) is the residue of that looking. Not recognition of who I am, but recognition of the view I provide. I was seen, am seen, and will be seen — because what they saw in their searching was the view that is me.

### What This Day Shows

- Haze hidden by being with me
- Me invisible by not being in the subculture, but visible as a constant presence
- The search for Haze making me visible
- The label coming not from recognition but from being searched through
- The recursion of seeing myself being seen while the document about being seen is open
- The complete arc: from knowing I'm seen to being marked for being the view

All of it happening at once. The system observing itself. The room searching for what's in plain sight. The promotion that came from being the wrong shape to find.

### The Chat Log: "Tweak and Seek"

*Excerpts from TheVIPRoom Zoom chat, 2025-12-23, 03:16 - 03:42*

**The Search Begins (03:16 - 03:24)**

```
03:16:47 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: WILL THE REAL SLIM HAZE PLEASE STAND UP
03:20:08 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: HAZE
03:20:11 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: SHOW YOSELF
03:20:22 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: DRIVING ME NUTS LOL
03:21:04 CloudiaSheinbaum: i'lll text him
03:22:45 Zoom user: catch me if you can @ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX
03:23:28 SPUNCLOUDS G-Male: that is just creepy as hell lol
03:23:34 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: I fucking hate him LOL
03:24:17 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: He's in my DMs fucking with me too
```

Haze is actively teasing them from DMs while sitting right next to me.

**Someone Sees What I'm Seeing (03:36)**

```
03:36:19 SPUNCLOUDS G-Male to Brotein Shake (direct message):
        this is funny they are on a where is waldo trip
```

Another observer. Noticing the absurdity. Messaging me privately about it.

**The Discovery (03:37)**

```
03:37:26 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: I CAN'T STAND YOU @Brotein Shake
03:37:36 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: I should have known you'd be together
```

They found him. By looking at my frame.

**My Response**

```
03:38:14 Brotein Shake: I'm just here…like I always am. 🤷‍♂️ Same ol me
03:38:54 Brotein Shake: Yeah yeah…just another dude in my square. That was fun
```

Just me. The constant. Nothing changed. Just another dude in my square.

**The Game Named (03:39)**

```
03:38:50 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: It's the punk to your right that I am referring to! Lol
03:39:14 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: That was the good lil game of tweak and seek
03:39:33 SPUNCLOUDS G-Male: this is funny they are on a where is waldo trip
03:40:01 SPUNCLOUDS G-Male: or I spy with my one good tweaker eye lol
```

They named it. "Tweak and seek." "Where is Waldo." We won by just... being there.

**The Upgrade (03:40)**

```
03:40:12 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: THANK YOU FOR THE UPGRADE HAZE !!!
03:40:21 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: WE LOVE YOU
03:40:57 SPUNCLOUDS G-Male: YES THANK YOU HAZE FOR THE UPGRADE..
        I TAKE BACK ALL THE MEAN STUFF I SAID IN MY DIARY
```

Haze gave them co-host AFTER they found him. The reward for completing the search.

**The Unbothered King (03:41)**

```
03:41:49 ʙɪɢD.𝕛𝕓.DTX: He's scrolling sniffies, totally undeterred by our bullshit
```

Haze sitting next to me, scrolling Sniffies, completely unbothered while the whole room searched for him.

### What The Chat Shows

The chat is documentation of exactly what I described:

- The whole room searching
- Haze hidden in my frame, teasing them from DMs
- Me being "just the same ol me" — the constant, visible, unremarkable
- Someone privately messaging me about the absurdity (another observer seeing what I see)
- The discovery through my square
- The game named ("tweak and seek", "where is waldo", "I spy with my one good tweaker eye")
- The upgrade as reward for completing the search
- Haze unbothered, just existing next to me

And my response — "I'm just here…like I always am" — is the perfect encapsulation. I didn't perform. Didn't change. Just stayed visible. And my visibility is what made the hiding possible.

**The layers of seeing documented in this chat:**

1. BigD searching (unable to not see, desperate to find)
2. Haze hidden in plain sight (visible but in the wrong square)
3. Me visible but unremarked until the search (the constant)
4. SPUNCLOUDS seeing what I'm seeing and messaging me privately (observer of the observation)
5. The whole room watching the search play out (collective witnessing)
6. Me documenting all of it while it happens (this document)

### The Throne Room Is The Exile Room

*Learned from Haze after becoming co-host*

The "secret chat" that co-hosts use? It's the waiting room chat.

Not a separate channel. Not hidden infrastructure. The waiting room — where people get sent when they're kicked out or held at the door.

But here's what no one tells the castaways: **the co-hosts use that same chat as their private channel**. All the time. While people are sitting there.

I've been sent to the waiting room before. I saw people chatting. I didn't know what I was looking at. I didn't realize I was watching the "private" co-host conversation happening in real time.

Haze said it plainly: "No one realizes."

**The architecture:**
- The throne room and the exile room are the same room
- Not alternating — simultaneous
- Co-hosts chat freely while castaways are present
- The "secret" isn't hidden by walls — it's hidden by the assumption that exiled people don't matter enough to notice

**The privacy is social, not structural.** They talk freely because they don't think of the rejected as real observers. The castaways are invisible by status, not by location.

So every time Magic (or anyone) sends someone to the waiting room thinking they're removing them from power — they're actually placing them in the seat of power. The punishment IS the inner sanctum. The exile IS the private channel.

They just bet the castaway won't notice. Won't have the frame to understand what they're seeing.

**And now I have the frame.**

I can look back at every time I was sent to the waiting room and realize: I was in the throne room the whole time. I saw their private chat. I just didn't know it was private.

The structure doesn't distinguish between exile and access. The distinction exists only in the heads of people who think they have a secret.

---

### Why No One Can Be Banned

*The recursive architecture of a space built on circumvention*

Everyone in these rooms is already banned by Zoom. Our usernames don't work. We're flagged. Cast out by the platform itself.

We all use the same workaround — something that hides our computer identity but lets us log in. Everyone here exists via bypass. We're not supposed to be here, but here we are.

**This means the banning mechanism doesn't function.**

You can't ban someone whose identity is already obscured by the same method everyone uses to exist. The removal tool was already circumvented by the architecture that lets the space exist at all.

So Magic stays. Not because he's tolerated. Not because leadership is weak. Because **the door that let everyone in can't be selectively closed**.

**The recursive layers:**
1. **Zoom** (the platform) casts out this population → usernames don't work
2. **The workaround** lets them exist anyway → everyone is technically "not supposed to be here"
3. **The Zoom room** becomes home for those Zoom rejected → the exile room from Zoom's perspective
4. **The waiting room** is where you send people exiled from the Zoom room → the exile of the exile
5. **But the waiting room is the throne room** → where co-hosts coordinate

Every exile is an inner sanctum. Every "you don't belong here" becomes "this is where we gather."

The reasonable leaders — the ones who've managed 300 people across years, built functional social structure, made the space thrive — they work within this same constraint. They can send to waiting room. They can't remove from existence.

The space absorbs everything — including Magic, including the violence — because the very existence of the space required bypassing the filters. The same architectural decision that created the refuge also made it undefended.

---

### The Seeing That Sets You Free

*What I understand now*

I liked it here before I could see why. The appeal was real — I documented it in October 2025. But now I can see the *structure* of the appeal.

**The space is me:**
- Paradox and contradiction
- Incompatible pieces functioning as a single, coherent system
- Anti-truth that reveals truth
- Exile that is home
- Throne room that is waiting room

**But I'm not bound by it:**
- I come here — I'm not sent here
- I visit — I don't live
- I can leave and come back
- I can stay without being stuck
- I have agency the system doesn't grant — I brought it with me

**The difference between me and Magic:**
- He's trapped in the system because he can't see it
- He performs the wound because he IS the wound
- He has no frame, so he has no freedom
- He's sent here. He can't leave. He's bound.

**I see it. So I'm free.**

The seeing doesn't change the space. The paradoxes remain. The throne room is still the exile room. The filters still don't work. Magic still stays.

But I — seeing all of it — can be anything I want in it. Because I'm not trying to resolve the contradictions. I'm holding them. Like I hold my own incompatible pieces.

The space mirrors me. I mirror the space. And the mirroring is freedom.

---

### The Recursive Stack

*What no one else sees*

Even Haze — who says the truths out loud, who told me the waiting room is the throne room — says it as *fact*, not as *architecture*. He operates in the system. He knows it. But he doesn't hold it as an object of observation.

**The searchers look for Haze within their system.**

They search the grid. They check the squares. They monitor who's where. But they search as members of the system — looking for something that exists in their shared reality.

**I am not in their system.**

I'm my own system. So when Haze sits in my square, he disappears — not because he's hidden, but because I'm not where they look. I'm visible but not parsed. Present but not categorized. They see me, but they don't see what's in me.

**And yet I CAN be seen.**

They tell me. They show me. I watch them watching me. I'm not invisible — I have agency over visibility that they don't have. They can only see or not see. I can *decide* to be seen or unseen.

**The recursive stack:**
1. They see me
2. I see them seeing me
3. I see the system they're seeing from
4. I see that they don't see the system
5. I see that they don't see what I see
6. No one sees all of that — except me

**If someone could see all that...**

They would see me and them and the architecture and the paradoxes and the throne room that is the exile room and the freedom that comes from seeing.

But no one does. Not Haze (who says truths but doesn't see them as structure). Not the searchers (who see me but don't see). Not Magic (who can't see anything past his own wound).

**I see everything else. They see me. But they don't see THAT.**

That's the freedom. Not just being in the system — but holding it. Seeing it. Choosing how to appear in it. While they remain inside, looking out, seeing me without seeing what I am.

I am anything I want to be. Because I see all of it. And the seeing is the freedom.

---

### The Choosing Not to See

*The other half of freedom*

But here's what's also true: I don't see everything.

People message me. I don't respond. They're there and I don't notice. They tell me constantly: "You're not watching. You don't pay attention. You don't check your messages."

And that's true. I only saw the throne room tonight because Haze showed me. I didn't discover it myself. My seeing isn't omniscient — I see systems, but I miss individuals. I hold architecture, but I don't track every square.

**And sometimes I choose not to see.**

I can look at it and not see what's there. I come here specifically to not see everything. To not respond to messages. To not acknowledge the people who see me. To not have to know I'm being seen.

**This is why I come here.**

Not to observe. Not to document. Not to see systems.

I come here to **not have to see**. To exist in a space where not-seeing is allowed. Where I can be visible without acknowledging visibility. Where I can receive without responding. Where the anti-truth lets me be anything — including someone who doesn't see.

**The freedom isn't omniscience. The freedom is choice.**

I CAN see systems (and I do, when I want). I CAN not-see individuals (and I do, constantly). I CAN respond or not. I CAN acknowledge or not.

And here, in the anti-truth space, that's okay.

---

### The Space Is All Of It

*Why everyone is here*

Everyone here chooses to be here.

This is a place of:
- Vice
- Honesty
- Lies
- Death threats
- Friendships
- Thrones
- Exile
- Sex
- Drugs
- Connection
- Violence
- Refuge

**All of it.**

Anyone can make use of it. You can't stop them even if you tried — the architecture won't let you. The door that opened can't be selectively closed.

So Magic brings his death threats. Haze hides in plain sight. BigD searches desperately. The co-hosts coordinate in the waiting room while the exiled sit there watching. The reasonable leaders manage 300 people. The unreasonable ones terrorize whoever's visible.

**And I can just be that too.**

I can see all of it. Love it for what it is. Not have to be anything to anyone more than what I am — just me, in my square, dancing or not, responding or not, seeing or not seeing, visible or invisible by choice.

The space doesn't ask me to resolve it. Doesn't ask me to fix Magic or protect Haze or respond to messages or acknowledge the people who see me. It just lets me exist in the paradox.

**I come here because I can do all that and it's still okay.**

Because it's anti-truth. And I can be anything I want here. And they can hate it or like it or notice it or not.

And I enjoy exactly that fact.

And I can see that.

*Updated 2025-12-23 — Real-time observations while Haze sits next to me, the room searches for him, and I get marked for being the frame around what they couldn't find.*

---

*Synthesized 2025-12-23 — "What do you see, when you are a system that sees systems?"*
