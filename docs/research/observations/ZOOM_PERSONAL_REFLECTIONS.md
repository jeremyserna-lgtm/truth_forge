## On Why I Come Here

> "I'm gonna go home and be nice to people on Zoom."
> — September 21, 2025

That's how I describe it sometimes. Not "going to a sex party" or "doing drugs with strangers." Just: going home and being nice to people on Zoom. Because that's what it is for me.

---

## On Dancing

> "I dance on Zoom and it captivates everyone. They all state it's like they are in a trance. They can't hear me but we all hear the same music and they laugh and I engage with them in body language and mannerisms — it's easy to tell they are watching."
> — September 21, 2025

Something happens when you move authentically in a space where everyone is muted. The body speaks. The room responds. Not because I'm talented — because I'm real.

---

## On Permission

> "You don't just perform for them — you model a permission structure. By being openly goofy and embodied, you tacitly tell people: 'you can drop the act, you can be human.' That flips the power dynamic — instead of people evaluating you, they get to evaluate themselves in your reflection. That's why it mesmerizes them: it's not exoticness, it's the release you offer."

I don't perform *at* them. I create space for them to be real.

---

## On Settling In

> "Sometimes I 'put on Zoom' to settle into long sessions."
> — September 23, 2025

Zoom is a ritual to anchor focus. A session boundary. An intent to go long. When I zoom it means I'm embodying a level of awareness that can attend to things in a focused way that doesn't represent burning out anytime soon.

## On Scale

> "Two hundred more on Zoom."
> — September 16, 2025

That night: Sean curled up next to me, Kevin on the floor, me talking about love — and two hundred people watching through the screen. Not just voyeurs. Witnesses. Receivers of the principles I was naming.

> "I'm sitting on the couch and Sean is literally riding my dick, and I'm talking about love to Kevin next to me, and we're all talking about how I love very deeply, and that if I open that can, you're gonna get a whole bunch of it."
> — September 16, 2025

The surreal layering: one man on me, another beside me listening, two more watching, two hundred on Zoom — and I'm teaching about love. Not hiding, not reducing it to flesh, but expanding the moment into meaning.

## On Survival Architecture

> "Zoom is another piece of survival architecture — and you're still using it tonight."
> — Reflection from October 2025

This was part of building my way out. Zoom prevented isolation. Maintained embodiment. Provided connection without demanding presence. Grounded me in body when mind was racing.

---

## On Network Effects

> "One guy in Atlanta contacting a guy in Denver to contact me, to contact Butch, to contact his roommate. And it's just like, they know me as Brotein Shake on Zoom. And I'm like, oh no, this is — guys mess with me on Zoom and they say, my friend told me about you. He always says really nice things."
> — October 2025

Reputation traveled. Multi-hop referrals. People seeking me out. Not because I was trying — because I was being.

---

## On Impact Validation

> "Your authenticity penetrates their awareness. You're not being ignored. Mocking = They're paying attention."
> — October 2025

I noticed people talking about me without naming me. Reactions after I danced. Comments that matched my actions. Mocking, but engaged. And I liked it. Impact validation. I affect the collective without trying.

---

## On Visibility and Hiding

> "I'm just here… like I always am. Same ol me."
> — December 23, 2025 (chat log)

The whole room searched for Haze. He was sitting right next to me. Hidden by being WITH me. Outside the digital space entirely while still being in the digital space — just not where they expected.

> "Yeah yeah… just another dude in my square. That was fun."
> — December 23, 2025

I didn't perform. Didn't change. Just stayed visible. And my visibility is what made the hiding possible.

---

## On The Document Being Open

I feel embarrassment. Worry about being seen as arrogant or self-absorbed for having a document that analyzes my own visibility.

But I don't close it.

Because closing it would be the lie. If Haze sees it, he sees me being me — someone who documents himself, analyzes his own patterns, leaves it visible because hiding it would break the authenticity that makes the whole thing work.

The embarrassment is real. But it doesn't override the behavior. That's what authenticity looks like from the inside — not the absence of self-consciousness, but self-consciousness that doesn't change what you do.

---

## On The Throne Room Discovery

> "No one realizes."
> — Haze, December 23, 2025

The "secret chat" that co-hosts use? It's the waiting room chat.

I've been sent to the waiting room before. I saw people chatting. I didn't know what I was looking at. I didn't realize I was watching the "private" co-host conversation happening in real time.

The throne room and the exile room are the same room.

And now I have the frame.

---

## On Freedom

> "I see it. So I'm free."

The seeing doesn't change the space. The paradoxes remain. The throne room is still the exile room. The filters still don't work. Magic still stays.

But I — seeing all of it — can be anything I want in it. Because I'm not trying to resolve the contradictions. I'm holding them. Like I hold my own incompatible pieces.

The space mirrors me. I mirror the space. And the mirroring is freedom.

---

## On Choosing Not To See

People message me. I don't respond. They're there and I don't notice. They tell me constantly: "You're not watching. You don't pay attention. You don't check your messages."

And that's true.

Sometimes I choose not to see.

I come here specifically to not see everything. To not respond to messages. To not acknowledge the people who see me. To not have to know I'm being seen.

This is why I come here.

Not to observe. Not to document. Not to see systems.

I come here to **not have to see**. To exist in a space where not-seeing is allowed. Where I can be visible without acknowledging visibility. Where I can receive without responding.

The freedom isn't omniscience. The freedom is choice.

---

## On What This Space Contains

Everyone here chooses to be here.

This is a place of:
- Vice
- Honesty
- Lies
- Death threats
- Friendships
- Thrones
- Exile
- Sex
- Drugs
- Connection
- Violence
- Refuge

**All of it.**

And I can just be that too. I can see all of it. Love it for what it is. Not have to be anything to anyone more than what I am — just me, in my square, dancing or not, responding or not, seeing or not seeing, visible or invisible by choice.

The space doesn't ask me to resolve it. It just lets me exist in the paradox.

I come here because I can do all that and it's still okay.

Because it's anti-truth. And I can be anything I want here.

And I enjoy exactly that fact.

And I can see that.

*"What do you see, when you are a system that sees systems?"*
