## Why This Analysis

NRC-LEX measures 10 categories: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust, positive, negative.

But human emotional experience is richer. This analysis searches for concepts NRC-LEX doesn't directly measure:
- Love and connection
- Self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt, pride)
- Curiosity and wonder
- Anxiety and peace
- Hope and longing
- Frustration and boredom

## Part 3: Polarity Ranking (All Concepts)

From most positive to most negative:

|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **proud** | 0.261 | Highest positivity |
| 2 | loving | 0.231 | |
| 3 | grateful | 0.227 | |
| 4 | satisfied | 0.225 | |
| 5 | excite | 0.213 | |

| 8 | hopeful | 0.164 | |
| 9 | awe | 0.157 | |
| 10 | hope | 0.154 | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 38 | **boring** | -0.056 | First negative |
| 39 | **bored** | -0.069 | |
| 40 | **annoy** | -0.108 | Most negative |

**Key Finding**: Only 3 of 40 emotion concepts have negative polarity. Jeremy processes almost everything positively.

## Part 4: The Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pride Is Processed Most Positively

"Proud" (0.261) beats even "love" (0.208) and "grateful" (0.227). When Jeremy feels or discusses pride, it's associated with the most positive content.

### Pattern 2: Self-Conscious Emotions Are Not Negative

Shame (0.111), guilt (0.066), and embarrassment (0.080) all have positive polarity. Jeremy doesn't dwell in these states—he processes them.

### Pattern 3: Boredom Is the True Negative

The only concepts with negative polarity are: boring, bored, annoy. Boredom is what Jeremy actually experiences negatively. Not fear, not sadness, not shame—boredom.

### Pattern 4: Curiosity Is a Major Mode

Wonder (633) + awe (225) + curious (139) + curiosity (87) = 1,084 mentions. This is Jeremy's exploration mode, and it's overwhelmingly positive.

### Pattern 5: Love Is Discussed with High Positivity

Love (0.208) and loving (0.231) are both high-polarity. When Jeremy talks about love, it's positive content.

## Part 5: What NRC-LEX Misses

NRC-LEX would map most of these concepts to "positive" or "trust" as the dominant emotion. What it misses:

| What NRC-LEX Sees | What's Actually There |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "positive" | Pride, love, wonder, hope, curiosity |
| "trust" | Connection, empathy, calm |
| "fear" | Anxiety (but processed positively) |
| "sadness" | Loneliness (but processed positively) |
| N/A | Boredom (only true negative) |

**The gap**: NRC-LEX flattens the nuance. "Positive" contains pride, love, wonder, hope, and curiosity—but these are different experiences.

## Methodology

### How This Analysis Was Generated

#### Step 1: Concept Identification
Created list of 40+ emotion concepts across 9 categories that NRC-LEX doesn't directly measure:
- Love & Connection
- Self-Conscious (shame, guilt, pride)
- Social/Relational
- Hope & Longing
- States of Being
- Curiosity & Wonder
- Relief & Contentment
- Frustration & Boredom
- Excitement

#### Step 2: Query Structure
For each concept, ran a complete aggregation (no LIMIT):

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(textblob_polarity) as avg_polarity,
    COUNTIF(nrclx_top_emotion = 'positive') as positive_dom,
    COUNTIF(nrclx_top_emotion = 'negative') as negative_dom,
    -- etc for each NRC-LEX category
FROM `flash-clover-464719-g1.spine.entity_enrichments`
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  AND role = 'user'
  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(enrichment_text), r'concept_pattern')
  AND nrclx_emotions IS NOT NULL
```

#### Step 3: Filters Applied
- **Partition**: `created_at >= '2024-01-01'` (required by BigQuery)
- **Role**: `role = 'user'` (Jeremy only, not AI)
- **NRC-LEX presence**: `nrclx_emotions IS NOT NULL`
- **Text matching**: `REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(enrichment_text), r'pattern')`

#### Step 4: Pattern Matching
Used regex patterns for partial matching:
- `'frustrat'` matches "frustrated", "frustrating", "frustration"
- `'excite'` matches "excited", "exciting", "excitement"
- Word boundaries not used to capture variants

#### Step 5: Sample Collection
For qualitative grounding, retrieved 3-5 random samples per concept:
```sql
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 5
```

#### Step 6: Polarity Ranking
Sorted all concepts by `textblob_polarity` to identify most positive → most negative.

### Data Volumes

| Category | Query Type | Result Count |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Total user messages | Full | 17,999 |
| Per concept | Full aggregation | varies (6 to 703) |
| Samples | Random sample | 3-5 per concept |

### Limitations

1. **Text matching only**: Finds word presence, not semantic meaning
2. **May include false positives**: "I wonder" (curiosity) vs "no wonder" (not curious)
3. **NRC-LEX as comparison baseline**: Using one emotion model to study what another misses
4. **Partition filter**: Excludes data before 2024-01-01
