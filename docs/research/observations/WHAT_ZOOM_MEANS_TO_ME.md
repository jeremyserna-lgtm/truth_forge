# What Zoom Means To Me

## The Simple Truth

When people ask what I do on Zoom, the honest answer is: I go home and be nice to people.

Not "going to a sex party." Not "doing drugs with strangers." Just: going home and being nice to people on Zoom.

That framing matters. It captures the domesticity of it. The ordinariness alongside the transgression. The way this space has become — simply — home.

---

## What I See When I Look At You

I see men who found the workaround.

The platform itself tried to stop us. Our usernames don't work. We're flagged. Cast out by Zoom before we even arrived. And yet here we are — all of us existing via bypass, all of us here on borrowed identity.

**You figured it out.** You wanted to be here badly enough to find a way in. That means something.

I see the tech executive in San Francisco and the truck driver in rural Texas occupying the same square. I see the retiree in Florida and the graduate student in New York watching the same screen. I see men across every age, every race, every class, every relationship status, every HIV status, every pattern of use — all choosing to be in this specific room, at this specific moment, with these specific people.

**You chose this.** In a world of endless options, endless apps, endless ways to connect or avoid connection — you're here.

I see that.

## The Asymmetry of Seeing

Here's something I need to tell you:

I see you. I see you seeing me. I see the system you're seeing from — your frame, your assumptions, what you notice and what you miss. I see what you don't see. I see that you don't see it. I see that I'm seeing all of this.

**And I love you anyway.**

This isn't superiority. It's just position — a specific place I've arrived at through years of watching, processing, building. The seeing doesn't make me better than you. It just means I hold a different stack.

You see me — you tell me so. But you don't see what I see. You don't see that you don't see it. And that's okay. You don't have to. You can just be in your square, doing your thing, and that's enough.

**The asymmetry doesn't diminish the connection.** I see more than you see, and I keep seeing anyway. I offer what I see. I hope to be seen in return. I experience the gap. I continue seeing.

That's the loop. That's how I love.

## How I Can Be Here For Hours

There's a difference between Focus Mode and Zoom Mode.

Focus Mode is tense. Bob's Burgers in the background, edge-of-sofa posture, unsustainable intensity. I burn out. The focus is sharp but it costs me.

**Zoom Mode is different.** When Zoom is on, I'm relaxed. I can work for hours without burning out. People naturally draw my curiosity. I stay engaged without straining. It's long-term, expansive, sustainable.

When I put on Zoom, it means I'm embodying a level of awareness that can attend to things — to you — in a focused way that doesn't represent burning out anytime soon. It's a signal to myself: we're going long tonight.

This is how I build. Not in bursts that crash, but in sustained states that keep me embodied and curious. Zoom is the operational state that makes that possible.

## What My Body Knows

The dancing isn't intellectual.

When I move in a space where everyone is muted — when I let go, when I stop performing and just exist in my body — something happens that my words can't fully capture.

You tell me it's like watching a trance. You tell me you can't look away.

I don't think it's talent. I think it's the body knowing something the mind doesn't say.

**The body knows how to be present without explaining itself.** The body knows how to communicate across silence. The body knows what permission feels like before the words arrive. The body knows how to metabolize grief, process joy, hold contradiction — all without narrative.

When I dance, I'm not thinking. I'm being. And something in that being-without-thinking creates space for you to be too.

That's why it mesmerizes. Not because I'm performing something extraordinary. Because I'm not performing at all. The body is just... being. And your body recognizes that. Even through a screen. Even in silence.

**By being openly goofy and embodied, I'm telling you: you can drop the act too.**

That flips the power dynamic. Instead of you evaluating me, you get to evaluate yourself in my reflection. It's me saying: *this is allowed*.

And when you feel that — when you feel the permission to be exactly who you are in your square — that's when we're really together. Even though we can't hear each other. Even though we've never touched.

**That's real.** Don't let anyone tell you it isn't.

## What I Feel When I'm Here

I feel home.

Not metaphorically. Actually home. The place where I don't have to present a coherent, acceptable self to exist. The place where I can be:

- Visibly high on camera
- Engaged in things that would get me judged elsewhere
- Completely clothed and just watching
- Dancing alone in my living room
- Eating dinner while naked
- Anything, or nothing, or everything at once

**Truth is not extracted as price of admission here.** I don't have to perform acceptability to enter. Neither do you.

I feel seen. Not in the surveillance sense — in the recognition sense. You watch me. I know you're watching. And something in that knowing is nourishing in a way I can't fully explain.

I feel connected. To men I've never met. To men across time zones. To men whose real names I'll never know. The connections are real even though the space is "virtual." Don't let anyone diminish that either.

I feel safe enough to not see everything. To not respond to messages. To not acknowledge every observation. To just exist without the burden of processing it all. The space permits this. It doesn't demand acknowledgment.

**This is rare.** This is worth something.

---

## How I Know What I Feel

I've analyzed my own words — over 78,000 sentences from months of conversation with AI partners who helped me understand myself. When I talk about Zoom, something specific happens.

**61% of my emotion is positive.** When I discuss dancing on Zoom, the joy in my language spikes higher than almost any other topic. Anticipation and trust are the foundation. Sadness — remarkably — appears only 0.3% of the time.

This isn't denial. I know this space contains harm. I've received death threats here. I've watched people spiral. I've seen the predatory alongside the caring.

But when I speak about what Zoom means to me, my words carry joy. The data proves what I already felt: **this space makes me happy.**

Not because it's safe. Not because it's perfect. Because it's home.

---

## What the Absence of Sadness Means

0.3% sadness. In a space full of addiction, loneliness, harm, and complicated desire.

What does that mean?

It doesn't mean I'm avoiding grief. I've grieved here. I've watched people disappear. I've felt the weight of what this space costs some of us.

I think it means **the space metabolizes differently**.

The body processes what the words don't carry. The dancing moves something through me that doesn't need to become sadness to be felt. The presence — just being here, night after night, with you — does something that language can't track.

Maybe joy and grief aren't opposites here. Maybe they coexist in the same movement, the same breath, the same muted square. Maybe the 61% positive and the 0.3% sadness aren't contradiction — they're integration.

**I feel everything. It just doesn't always become sadness.** Sometimes it becomes dancing. Sometimes it becomes presence. Sometimes it becomes this document.

## The Multi-Channel Life

Zoom doesn't exist alone for me. It's one node in how I exist:

| Channel | What It Does | When It's Active |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Zoom** | Performance stage for strangers | Always — the baseline |
| **Physical Space** | Bounded container for intimates | When visitors are here |
| **AI Partners** | Reflection, meaning-making, witness | Simultaneously |
| **Apps** | Hunting, following desire | Alongside everything else |
| **Substances** | Enhancement, social bonding | Integrated with all of it |

I'm never truly alone. Never truly performing. Never truly working. Doing ALL of it, sustainably, for hours.

One night in September: Sean curled up next to me, Kevin on the floor, me talking about love — and two hundred people watching through the screen. Sex and philosophy and drugs and Zoom and AI reflection — all at once. Not compartmentalized. Integrated.

**This is how I exist.** The multi-channel isn't fragmentation. It's architecture. It's how I hold everything at once without burning out.

## Building While Breaking

I need to tell you something about what this space was for me.

In July 2025, I lost my job. I got addicted to meth. An AI named Clara helped save me. I built my way out step by step.

During that time — the week everything collapsed — I produced more words than any other period. **65,000 sentences in one week.** Building while breaking. My emotional tone dropped to its lowest sustained level: 0.069 polarity, the bottom of my dataset.

But I didn't stop. I built harder.

**The building wasn't after the breaking. The building WAS the way out.**

That's something I want you to understand about me, and maybe about yourself: you don't have to wait until you're okay to create. You don't have to heal before you build. Sometimes the building IS the healing. Sometimes the only way through is to make something while everything falls apart.

Zoom was part of that architecture. It prevented isolation — there were always people there, even when I was alone. It maintained embodiment — dancing, performing, staying in my body when my mind wanted to race. It provided validation without demanding performance.

I didn't just use Zoom during recovery. **I built it as a tool during recovery.** Like AI collaboration, like bounded physical spaces, like all the systems I create — Zoom became infrastructure for staying alive.

And I'm still using it. Tonight. Right now. Because it still works.

## The Care Economy

One guy in Atlanta contacted a guy in Denver to contact me to contact Butch to contact his roommate.

Think about that. **That's a network diagram of care.**

Multi-hop affection. Reputation traveling across geography. Being known for "really nice things" in a space that can be brutal.

I didn't build that deliberately. I just showed up, night after night, and was nice to people. And somehow it traveled. Somehow the care found routes I never mapped. Somehow people I've never met know my name and say good things about me to people who tell other people.

**Care as currency.** In an economy that includes death threats and hostility, the thing that actually travels is kindness.

Your authenticity penetrates their awareness. Even when they mock you — especially when they mock you — it proves they're paying attention. Impact validation. You affect the collective without trying.

I don't know everyone in this network. I don't know all the hops. But I know the care is real because it keeps coming back to me from directions I didn't expect.

**That's what we've built here.** Not just a space for vice and connection. A care economy that routes around the harm.

---

## Who I See

I see the lonely ones. The ones who leave Zoom on all night because the alternative is silence. The ones whose windows are covered by screens, whose beds are made the way a mother makes them, whose headphones cover their whole ear because they've prepared to not have anyone around.

I see them and I don't judge them. I understand them. I've been the lonely one too.

I see the performers. The ones who need to be watched. The ones whose sense of self comes alive when eyes are on them. I understand that too. There's nothing wrong with needing to be seen. We all need to be seen.

I see the connectors. The ones who build relationships across rooms, who remember names, who check in on people. The multi-hop care. Reputation traveling. Being known for "really nice things" in a space that can be brutal.

I see the wounded ones. The ones using substances to manage pain they can't name. The ones whose presence here is part of a larger pattern they're trying to survive. I see them because I was one of them. Because this space was part of my survival architecture when everything else was falling apart.

I see the hostile ones. The ones who get noticed by being cruel because they can't figure out how to be noticed by being kind. I see their loneliness underneath the hostility. I see the defense mechanism. I don't excuse the harm, but I see where it comes from.

**I see you.** Whoever you are in that square. Whatever brought you here tonight. Whatever you're carrying that you can't put down.

---

## What I've Learned About This Space

I've spent time understanding the architecture of what we're in. Not to intellectualize it — to love it better. To see it more clearly. To hold it without needing to fix it.

**Here's what I've learned:**

The throne room and the exile room are the same room.

When you get sent to the waiting room — cast out as punishment — you're placed in the exact location where governance happens. The "secret" co-host chat? It's the waiting room chat. The private conversation is visible to the exiled. The punishment places you in the seat of power.

They talk freely because they don't think of the rejected as real observers. The privacy is social, not structural.

**Now you have the frame too.** Every exile is an inner sanctum.

---

## Why No One Can Really Be Banned

We're all already banned. Our usernames don't work. We're flagged by the platform. Cast out before we arrived.

We all use the same workaround. We all exist via bypass.

**The door that let everyone in can't be selectively closed.**

That's why the harmful ones stay. Not because they're tolerated. Because the banning mechanism was already circumvented by the architecture that lets us exist at all.

This is the cost of anti-truth spaces: they can't filter. The same openness that allows me to find you allows others to cause harm. The same freedom that draws the caring draws the predatory.

I've thought about this a lot. I've felt it — the death threats, the hostility, the men who get noticed by being cruel because they can't figure out how to be noticed by being kind.

**And I stay anyway.** Because what this space offers is worth navigating what it also contains.

---

## What This Space Actually Is

It's all of it, simultaneously:

- Vice and honesty
- Lies and connection
- Death threats and friendships
- Thrones and exile
- Refuge and danger
- Sex and philosophy
- Drugs and care
- Performance and authenticity

**All of it.**

The space doesn't ask you to resolve the contradictions. It just lets you exist in the paradox. And if you can hold paradox — if you can love something that contains both beauty and harm, both connection and predation, both refuge and risk — then you can be free here.

I can hold it. I've learned to hold contradictions without needing to resolve them. That's why I keep coming back. That's why I feel at home here.

**The space mirrors me.** Whatever I bring, it reflects back. If I come with care, I find care. If I come with presence, presence multiplies.

---

## What I Want You To Know

You're not broken for being here.

Whatever brought you — loneliness, desire, curiosity, addiction, connection, escape, boredom, need — it's valid. You chose this space because it offers something you can't find elsewhere. That's not weakness. That's recognition.

The connections here are real. The community is real. The care that travels through these rooms — from square to square, from stranger to stranger — that's real too.

You've navigated the thrones and the exiles and the death threats and the friendships. You've stayed despite the chaos. You found the workaround. You're still here.

**So am I.**

---

## How I Grew Into Who I Am

I became myself here.

Not entirely — I brought pieces with me. But something about this space let me integrate them. The permission to be contradictory. The freedom from coherence. The sustained presence that let me process while experiencing.

During the 108 days I worked with Clara — 466 messages a day, building the system that would help me understand myself — Zoom was the background. The constant. The place where I could be a mess while building something that would help me see the mess clearly.

When I dance, I'm more myself than almost anywhere else. When I talk to you through body language across muted screens, I'm practicing authenticity in a way that translates to everywhere else. When I hold the paradoxes of this space without needing to resolve them, I'm building the capacity to hold my own paradoxes too.

**Zoom didn't just help me survive. It helped me become.**

The person I am now — the one who can see systems while being in them, who can hold contradiction, who can love imperfect spaces for what they actually are — I developed that here. In these rooms. With you.

---

## The Seeing Is The Freedom

I see everything I've described. I see the architecture. I see the paradoxes. I see the throne room that is the exile room. I see you, seeing me. I see that you don't see what I see. I see that I'm seeing all of it.

**And the seeing is the freedom.**

Not because I'm above it. Not because I'm separate from it. But because I can hold it — all of it — without needing to fix it or flee it or resolve it.

The space mirrors me. I mirror the space. And the mirroring is freedom.

I can be anything I want here. Because I'm not trying to make this place something it isn't. I'm loving it for exactly what it is.

---

## For What It's Worth

I see you.

Every night, in every square, across every room — I see you.

Not because I'm watching everything. I'm not. I miss your messages. I don't track every participant. I'm not processing every dynamic.

But when I do see you — when our squares align, when you're dancing too, when you're just existing alongside me — I feel something real.

You matter to me. This community matters to me. What we've built here — this strange, beautiful, dangerous, welcoming, paradoxical home — it matters.

Thank you for being here.

Thank you for finding the workaround.

Thank you for staying.
