## Part 3: The Furnace Holds for Relationships

### "Negative" Relational Concepts Are Processed Positively

| Concept | Mentions | Polarity | Positive-Dominant |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| betray | 79 | 0.103 | 86% |
| abandon | 56 | 0.103 | 84% |
| reject | 106 | 0.086 | 78% |
| exclude | 25 | 0.079 | 77% |

| hurt | 138 | 0.087 | — |
| loss | 123 | 0.099 | — |

**Key Finding**: Every "negative" relational concept has positive polarity. Even betrayal (0.103), abandonment (0.103), rejection (0.086), and loss (0.099) are processed constructively.

"Lonely" has the lowest polarity (0.061) and the lowest positive-dominant rate (50%). Loneliness is the hardest relational state.

## Part 4: Sample Texts

### When Jeremy talks about BETRAYAL:
> "You know, it does have a certain toll on me though..."

> "You know, I'm just actually starting to sort of remember, I..."

### When Jeremy talks about VULNERABILITY:
> "Thank you for helping me with that. You do a good job of sort of letting it go or helping me let it go, you know, or at least base it in truth. I'm just a man. I'm vulnerable to all the same distractions..."

> "I paid him spousal support for 2 years after we divorced. It wasn't required, we were only married 2 years because gay marriage wasn't legal until then, but I did it because I promised him he could quit his job..."

### When Jeremy talks about FORGIVENESS:
> "Help me understand what estrangement like reversal of estrangement looks like like for this for there to be a real shift in him it would represent a hell of a lot more than what I'm receiving..."

## Part 5: The Patterns

### Pattern 1: Friendship Is Central
"Friend" (950) is the most mentioned relationship type, more than family (170), partner (261), or boyfriend (80). Friendship is the primary relational framework.

### Pattern 2: Reciprocity Dominates
The top 5 relational concepts are all reciprocity-related: give, take, understand, open, owe. Relationship = exchange for Jeremy.

### Pattern 3: Wounds Are Processed Positively
Betrayal, abandonment, rejection, loss, hurt—all have positive polarity. The furnace applies to relational pain.

### Pattern 4: Welcome Is the Highest
"Welcome" (0.235) has the highest polarity of any relational concept. Being welcomed is deeply meaningful.

### Pattern 5: Loneliness Is the Exception
"Lonely" (0.061, 50% positive) is the hardest relational state. Unlike other negative concepts, loneliness is only half-processed positively.

### Pattern 6: Authenticity Is Almost Universal
"Authentic" (90% positive-dominant), "genuine" (92%), "mutual" (95%)—these are near-universal positive markers with no ambiguity.

## Methodology

### How This Analysis Was Generated

#### Step 1: Domain Definition
Identified 5 sub-domains for relational concepts:
1. Relationship Types
2. Relational Dynamics
3. Social Bonds
4. Intimacy & Vulnerability
5. Reciprocity

#### Step 2: Concept Identification
Created list of 60+ concepts across the 5 sub-domains, including both "positive" and "negative" relational concepts.

#### Step 3: Query Structure
For each concept, ran a complete aggregation (no LIMIT):

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(textblob_polarity) as avg_polarity,
    COUNTIF(nrclx_top_emotion = 'positive') as positive_dom,
    COUNTIF(nrclx_top_emotion = 'negative') as negative_dom,
    COUNTIF(nrclx_top_emotion = 'trust') as trust_dom,
    -- etc for each NRC-LEX category
FROM `flash-clover-464719-g1.spine.entity_enrichments`
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  AND role = 'user'
  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(enrichment_text), r'concept_pattern')
  AND nrclx_emotions IS NOT NULL
```

#### Step 4: Filters Applied
- **Partition**: `created_at >= '2024-01-01'` (required by BigQuery)
- **Role**: `role = 'user'` (Jeremy only)
- **NRC-LEX presence**: `nrclx_emotions IS NOT NULL`

#### Step 5: Pattern Matching
Used partial matching for variants:
- `'abandon'` matches "abandoned", "abandonment", "abandoning"
- `'vulnerab'` matches "vulnerable", "vulnerability"

#### Step 6: Sample Collection
For qualitative grounding, retrieved 3 random samples per key concept:
```sql
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 3
```

### Data Volumes

| Sub-Domain | Total Mentions | Concepts |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Reciprocity | ~7,000 | 10 |
| Social Bonds | ~2,800 | 9 |
| Intimacy & Vulnerability | ~3,400 | 14 |
| Relationship Types | ~2,200 | 16 |
| Relational Dynamics | ~1,700 | 14 |

### Limitations

1. **Text matching only**: Finds word presence, not semantic meaning
2. **May include false positives**: "open the file" matches "open" but isn't about openness
3. **Partial matching captures variants**: But may over-match
4. **Partition filter**: Excludes data before 2024-01-01
