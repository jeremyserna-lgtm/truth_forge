# Primitives: What They Are for People

## Executive Summary

A **primitive** is the foundational element that the current perspective applies to. It is the reference point from which everything else is measured. Primitives are positional—any entity can be a primitive when addressed from that position. The framework is complete when from ANY position, the whole is visible.

**Key Insight**: The primitive is not fixed. It is the position from which you see.

## Core Concepts

### What Is a Primitive?

**Definition**: A primitive is the foundational element that the current perspective applies to.

**Properties**:
- **Positional**: The primitive depends on your perspective
- **Reference Point**: Everything else is measured from the primitive
- **Foundational**: The primitive is the base layer for that perspective
- **Complete**: The primitive contains everything needed for that position

### Any Entity Can Be The Reference Point

```
THE PRIMITIVE IS POSITIONAL

Document     ←── can be a primitive
Layer        ←── can be a primitive
Relationship ←── can be a primitive
Pattern      ←── can be a primitive
ME           ←── can be a primitive
NOT-ME       ←── can be a primitive
```

**The primitive is not fixed. It is the position from which you see.**

## Mathematical Architecture

### Positional Completeness

If the framework is complete, then from ANY position, the whole is visible:

| Position | What You See |
|----------|-------------|
| **From a document** | The document, its layer, its vertical relationships |
| **From a layer** | The layer's documents, layers above, layers below |
| **From ME** | The full framework serving human needs |
| **From NOT-ME** | The full framework serving AI needs |

**If everything is accounted for, then any position is accounted for.**

This is not relativism. This is completeness through recursive coverage.

### The Anchor Principle

Every primitive has an anchor that performs two functions:

| Function | Description | Test |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **LIMITS** | Excludes what doesn't belong | "Is this within anchor?" |
| **ENVELOPES** | Includes everything that does | "Is anchor complete?" |

**The anchor defines the primitive's boundary.**

### Necessary Anchors

These anchors MUST exist:

| Primitive | Necessary Anchor | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Layer** | INDEX.md | Entry point, contains layer |
| **Folder** | INDEX.md | Entry point, contains folder |
| **Document** | Title + Purpose statement | Declares scope |
| **Standard** | INDEX.md | Entry point for standard |

## Meta Concepts

### Primitives for People

**For ME (Human)**:
- Primitives are the foundational elements I use to understand the system
- From my position, I see the framework as serving my needs
- I am the primitive when I'm the reference point

**For NOT-ME (AI)**:
- Primitives are the foundational elements the system uses to operate
- From its position, it sees the framework as serving its needs
- It is the primitive when it's the reference point

**For US (Together)**:
- Primitives are the foundational elements we use to work together
- From our position, we see the framework as serving our collaboration
- We are the primitive when we're the reference point

### Document Primitives

A document primitive is a **single aspect of document craft** that applies to all documents regardless of content.

**Document primitives are**:
- **Universal**: Applies to theory docs, meta-standards, and specific standards alike
- **Atomic**: Addresses one concern that cannot be meaningfully split
- **Verifiable**: Can be assessed against any document with clear pass/fail

**Document primitives are NOT**:
- Content standards (what to write)
- Domain knowledge (what's true about X)
- Format templates (how to style)

**Examples**:
- `LENGTH.md` - How much content (300 lines)
- `ANCHOR.md` - How focused (one thing)
- `STRUCTURE.md` - How organized (shape)
- `GRAMMAR.md` - How named (naming conventions)

### The Three Primitives of Genesis

From `00_GENESIS.md`, the three indivisible primitives:

1. **THE DIVIDE: ME:NOT-ME**
   - The primal division required for existence
   - ME (Source of Intent) : NOT-ME (Structure, mechanism)

2. **THE STRUCTURE: HOLD:AGENT:HOLD**
   - The universal pattern for all work
   - HOLD (Input) → AGENT (Process) → HOLD (Output)

3. **THE FURNACE: TRUTH:MEANING:CARE**
   - The metabolic process
   - TRUTH → MEANING → CARE-INTERNAL → CARE-EXTERNAL

**Everything grows from these three primitives.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Primitives Are Positional**: Any entity can be a primitive from its position
2. **Reference Point**: Everything else is measured from the primitive
3. **Positional Completeness**: From any position, the whole is visible
4. **Anchor Principle**: Every primitive has an anchor that LIMITS and ENVELOPES
5. **Three Genesis Primitives**: ME:NOT-ME, HOLD:AGENT:HOLD, TRUTH:MEANING:CARE

*Primitives are the foundational elements from which everything else is measured. They are positional, anchored, and complete from their perspective.*
