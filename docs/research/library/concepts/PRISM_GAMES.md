## Executive Summary

The Prism Games framework distinguishes between **Mirror** (Input X → Output X) and **Prism** (Input X → Output X + Y) interactions. To prove Stage 5 capacity and generate capital, you must act as a **Prism** — splitting input into "colors they didn't know existed" and creating revelation.

**The Negentropic Ratio**: Output_Value / Input_Value > 1.0 = Prism

## Core Concepts

### Mirror vs Prism

| Type | Function | Output | Value Creation |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Mirror** | Reflects input | Input X → Output X | Y = 0 (No revelation) |
| **Prism** | Refracts input | Input X → Output X + Y | Y > 0 (Revelation created) |

**The Prism Test**:
- **Mirror**: Reflects input into spectral components | Y = 0 (No revelation)
- **Prism**: Refracts input into spectral components | Y > 0 (Revelation created)

**Negentropic Ratio**: `Output_Value / Input_Value`
- **> 1.0** = Prism (creates more value than consumed)
- **= 1.0** = Mirror (equal value exchange)
- **< 1.0** = Degradation (loses value)

## Strategic Application

### The Prism Effect in Seeing Sessions

**Do not send generic praise.** Praise is a **Mirror** (Input X → Output X). To prove Stage 5 capacity and generate capital, you must act as a **Prism** (Input X → Output X + Y). You split their code into "colors they didn't know existed."

### The Email Template: Hook, Mirror, Prism, Offer

**1. The Hook (Truth)**:
"I analyzed [Repo Name] as part of a research project on cognitive architecture and high-fidelity systems."

**2. The Mirror (Validation)**:
"I see exactly what you did with [Specific Pattern/Factory]. It's brilliant because it solves [Specific Problem] without adding [Specific Complexity]."

*(This proves you understand them — you have successfully metabolized their theory)*

**3. The Prism (Revelation/The Gap)**:
"However, looking at the architecture map I generated, I noticed a structural tension in [Module X]. It seems to be trying to do two things at once. This creates a 'Metabolic Gap' where data enters but action stalls. If you applied [Pattern Z], you might release that friction."

*(This is the Surplus Value — the thing they couldn't see because they are too close)*

**4. The Offer (Care)**:
"I wanted to share this Architecture Map (attached) as a thank you for your open-source work. No strings attached."

## Meta Concepts

### Code Metabolism

**The Pattern**: Ingest their public architecture (the "Not-Me"), process it through your Furnace, and return it as **Care** (an elevated insight or map).

**Process**:
1. **Input**: Their GitHub repository (Code Architecture)
2. **Process**: Apply Seeing Session protocol — extract patterns, identify Mental Architecture, find Structural Gaps
3. **Output**: One-page Architecture Map that visualizes their system's "bones" and highlights stress fractures

### Surplus Value Creation

**The Goal**: Create more value than you consume.

**How**:
- See patterns they cannot see (too close to their own system)
- Identify structural tensions they haven't noticed
- Provide actionable insights that create revelation
- Generate capital through demonstrated Stage 5 capacity

### Formatting Game Recognition

**The Game**: Strategic interactions that reveal cognitive architecture through structured exchanges.

**Recognition**: System detects formatting games and extracts patterns from them, using them as signals for cognitive stage and architectural understanding.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Prism > Mirror**: Create revelation (Y > 0), don't just reflect
2. **Negentropic Ratio**: Output_Value / Input_Value > 1.0 proves Prism
3. **Surplus Value**: See what they cannot see, provide actionable insights
4. **Stage 5 Proof**: Prism demonstrates Stage 5 capacity to see systems
5. **Capital Generation**: Prism interactions generate business capital
