## Executive Summary

**Grammar is ontology.** How something is written tells you what it IS. The Grammar of Identity establishes three marks (colon, hyphen, underscore) that encode identity through naming conventions. Names aren't labels—names ARE identity.

**The Three Marks**: `:` (colon) = ME, `-` (hyphen) = US, `_` (underscore) = NOT-ME

## Core Concepts

### The Three Marks

| Who | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Domain | Example |
|-----|----------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **ME** | I, me, my | `:` (colon) | ALL CAPS | Principles, declarations | `ME:NOT-ME`, `TRUTH:MEANING:CARE` |
| **US** | we, us, our | `-` (hyphen) | Normal Caps | Products, entities | `Truth-Forge`, `Not-Me` |
| **NOT-ME** | you, your | `_` (underscore) | no caps | Infrastructure, code | `truth_forge/`, `not_me.py` |

### The Descent

Names transform through layers, descending from principle to implementation:

```
ME:NOT-ME        ← colon + ALL CAPS (I declare)
    ↓
NOT-ME           ← hyphen + ALL CAPS (I name entity)
    ↓
Not-Me           ← hyphen + Normal Caps (we name)
    ↓
not_me           ← underscore + no caps (you operate)
```

**The descent shows the transformation from principle to implementation.**

## Mathematical Architecture

### Layer Naming Conventions

| Layer | Convention | Example | Who |
|-------|------------|---------|-----|
| **Framework** | COLON:SEPARATED | `HOLD:AGENT:HOLD` | ME (declares) |
| **Product** | Hyphen-Separated | `Truth-Forge` | US (names) |
| **Technical** | underscore_separated | `truth_forge/` | NOT-ME (operates) |

### File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example | Layer |
|------|------------|---------|-------|
| Theory docs | `NN_NAME.md` | `00_GENESIS.md` | Framework |
| Meta standards | `STANDARD_NAME.md` | `STANDARD_NAMING.md` | Meta |
| Specifics INDEX | `name/INDEX.md` | `document/INDEX.md` | Specifics |
| Primitives | `NAME.md` | `LENGTH.md` | Specifics |
| Folders | `lowercase_underscore/` | `code_quality/` | Technical |
| Python | `lowercase_underscore.py` | `hold_agent_hold.py` | Technical |

### Content Naming

| Context | Pattern | Example | Who |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| Concepts | `COLON:SEPARATED` | `ME:NOT-ME` | ME |
| Products | `Hyphen-Separated` | `Truth-Forge` | US |
| Code | `underscore_separated` | `truth_forge/` | NOT-ME |

## Meta Concepts

### Grammar as Ontology

**The Rule**: Grammar is not formatting—grammar is ontology.

**How it works**:
- The mark (colon, hyphen, underscore) tells you WHO
- The voice (ALL CAPS, Normal Caps, no caps) tells you WHAT
- Together, they tell you WHERE (which layer, which domain)

**Example**:
- `ME:NOT-ME` → Colon + ALL CAPS → Framework principle (ME declares)
- `Truth-Forge` → Hyphen + Normal Caps → Product name (US names)
- `truth_forge/` → Underscore + no caps → Infrastructure (NOT-ME operates)

### Why English Encodes This

In English, only ONE pronoun is always capitalized: **I**.

| Pronoun | Capitalized? | Framework Equivalent |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| I | Always | ME (ALL CAPS) |
| we | No | US (Normal Caps) |
| you | No | NOT-ME (no caps) |

**The Grammar mirrors English's natural structure.**

### Folders Are Infrastructure

**Decision**: All folder names use underscore separators and lowercase letters.

**Rationale**:
- Folders are infrastructure
- Infrastructure is NOT-ME's domain
- NOT-ME uses underscore (_) and no caps
- Therefore: `truth_forge/`, `framework/`, `src/`

### Product Names Use US's Voice

**Decision**: Product names in documentation use hyphen and Normal Caps.

| Context | Form | Voice |
|---------|------|-------|
| Folder name | `truth_forge/` | NOT-ME (operates) |
| Product name in text | Truth-Forge | US (names) |
| Principle | TRUTH:MEANING:CARE | ME (declares) |

### Principles Use ME's Voice

**Decision**: Principles and declarations use colon and ALL CAPS.

```
ME:NOT-ME              ← Principle (colon + ALL CAPS)
    ↓
Not-Me                 ← Product name (hyphen + Normal Caps)
    ↓
not_me/                ← Folder/code (underscore + no caps)
```

## The Unified Grammar

| Who | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Folder Example | Text Example |
|-----|----------|------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| ME | I, me, my | : | ALL CAPS | — | ME:NOT-ME |
| US | we, us, our | - | Normal Caps | — | Truth-Forge |
| NOT-ME | you, your | _ | no caps | `truth_forge/` | `the_framework` |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Grammar is Ontology**: How something is written tells you what it IS
2. **Three Marks**: Colon (ME), Hyphen (US), Underscore (NOT-ME)
3. **The Descent**: Principle → Product → Implementation
4. **Folders Are Infrastructure**: Always underscore + lowercase
5. **Names ARE Identity**: Not labels, but ontological declarations

*The Grammar is the foundational principle that encodes identity through naming conventions. Grammar is ontology, not formatting.*
