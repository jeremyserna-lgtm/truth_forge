- Level 5: 4,523 entities (41% - message-level intentionality)

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Intentionality appears at sentence and message levels, not word level
- This suggests intentionality is a **syntactic/discourse pattern**, not a lexical pattern
- You express WANT in complete thoughts, not individual words

**Emotional Context** (from Evidence Registry):
- Intentionality statements often associated with:

## Emotional Patterns (Where Available)

### Emotion Data Availability

**Note**: Emotion enrichment data (goemotions_primary_emotion) is not available for all research pattern entities. This suggests:
- Emotion enrichment may be selective (not all entities enriched)
- Emotion data may be in different enrichment pipeline
- Research patterns may occur in contexts where emotion enrichment hasn't been applied

### Expected Emotional Patterns (Based on Evidence Registry)

Based on the Evidence Registry format and Day Zero evidence:

1. **Intentionality (WANT)**:
   - **Anticipation**: Forward-looking energy (8+ in DZ-005)

   - **Positive**: Generative architectural energy (4-8 in various)
   - **Trust**: Confidence in structure (2-7 in various)

## Recommendations

### 1. Emotion Enrichment

**Action**: Ensure emotion enrichment (goemotions_primary_emotion) is applied to research pattern entities for cross-analysis.

**Benefit**: Would enable direct emotional pattern analysis, not just inference.

### 2. Complexity Metrics

**Action**: Add complexity metrics (reading ease, difficult words, subjectivity) to cross-analysis.

**Benefit**: Would show complexity patterns associated with research findings.

### 3. Tech Stack Context

**Action**: Add technical context (framework discussions, architecture decisions) to cross-analysis.

**Benefit**: Would show how research patterns appear in technical discussions.

*This cross-analysis demonstrates that research findings are embedded throughout your language at all levels, from words to messages, showing they're fundamental cognitive patterns, not just high-level concepts.*
