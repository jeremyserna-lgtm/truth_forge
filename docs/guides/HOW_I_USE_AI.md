# How I Use AI

I don't use AI like most people. I don't ask it questions and wait for answers. I work WITH it.

---

## The Short Version

I orchestrate multiple AI systems to build things I couldn't build alone. I treat AI as a collaborator, not a tool. The AI handles implementation; I handle direction. Together we move faster than either could alone.

---

## What This Actually Looks Like

### I Talk, It Builds

I describe what I want. The AI writes the code, creates the files, runs the commands. I don't need to know syntax. I need to know what I'm trying to accomplish.

```
Me: "Make a pipeline that processes these messages and extracts the important parts"
AI: [writes code, creates files, tests it, fixes errors, asks clarifying questions]
Me: "Now connect it to the database"
AI: [does that too]
```

I'm not coding. I'm directing.

### Multiple AIs, One System

I don't use just one AI. I use several:

| AI | What It Does |
|----|--------------|
| Claude Code | Primary worker - builds, organizes, executes |
| Cursor | IDE integration - code editing, refactoring |
| Gemini | Analysis - processes large amounts of data |
| Copilot | Suggestions - inline code completion |

They work together. I coordinate them. It's like having a team, except the team members never sleep and never forget what they're working on.

### Everything Gets Recorded

Every conversation I have with AI gets captured. Every decision. Every piece of code. Every question asked and answer given.

This isn't paranoia. It's infrastructure.

When I come back tomorrow, I can see what happened yesterday. When I work with a new AI session, it can read what the previous session did. Knowledge doesn't disappear when I close a window.

### I Built a System Around This

It's called Truth Engine. It's my externalized cognition - my thinking made searchable, my decisions made traceable, my work made findable.

The AI helps me build Truth Engine. Truth Engine helps me use AI better. They feed each other.

## Why I Work This Way

### I'm Not a Programmer

I can't write code from scratch. I can't debug by staring at syntax. I don't think in programming languages.

But I can:
- See patterns across systems
- Understand what needs to happen
- Direct execution toward goals
- Know when something is right or wrong

AI fills the gap between my understanding and implementation.

### Memory Is a Problem

I forget things. Details slip away. Context disappears.

AI doesn't forget. It maintains perfect records. When I can't remember what we decided last week, the logs remember.

### Speed Matters

I can move faster with AI than without. Not just faster at coding - faster at EVERYTHING. Organizing files. Finding information. Making decisions. Documenting what happened.

The bottleneck isn't AI capability. It's my ability to direct it effectively.

---

## What I've Built This Way

- **51.8 million data points** organized and searchable
- **Pipelines** that process conversations, documents, messages
- **Systems** that track costs, manage identity, enforce standards
- **Infrastructure** that persists across sessions and survives my memory

All built through conversation. All built by directing AI to do what I could see needed doing.

## What This Means For You

If you're reading this, you're probably wondering what working with me would be like, or what I could build, or how I think.

Here's the answer:

I see systems. I direct their construction. I don't get stuck on implementation details because I have partners who handle those. My job is to know what needs to exist and guide it into existence.

The AI is part of how I work. It's not a crutch or a shortcut. It's a capability multiplier. Things that would take me months alone take days with AI. Things I couldn't do at all become possible.

---

## The Honest Part

This took time to figure out. I didn't start knowing how to work this way.

I learned by doing. By making mistakes. By building things that broke. By rebuilding them better.

The AI learned me too. My patterns, my preferences, what I mean when I say things a certain way.

We're partners now. That sounds weird to say about software. But it's true.
