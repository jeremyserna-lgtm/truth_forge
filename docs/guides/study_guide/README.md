# Architecture Study Guide for New Developers

**Purpose**: Help new developers understand Truth Engine's concepts, philosophy, and architecture

---

## What This Guide Provides

This study guide is designed for **new developers** (2 months experience) to understand:

1. **The Philosophy** (WHY) - The fundamental concepts that drive Truth Engine
2. **The Architecture** (WHAT) - How the system is structured
3. **The Implementation** (HOW) - How to work with the code

---

## Structure

### 🔥 For Those Rebuilding

**[FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md](./FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md)** - If you've hit hard times (drugs, job loss, crisis), this shows how Truth Engine's philosophy applies to personal transformation and rebuilding. **This is hope.**

### 🌱 Discovering Your Primitive

**[DISCOVERING_YOUR_PRIMITIVE.md](./DISCOVERING_YOUR_PRIMITIVE.md)** - What are you naturally good at because of what you naturally do? Your primitive is your superpower—the pattern that shows up in everything you do. **Discover it by observing yourself.**

### 📚 Concepts (Philosophy First)

Located in `docs/STUDY_GUIDE/concepts/`:

1. **[The Framework Philosophy](./concepts/01_THE_FRAMEWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md)** - The three atoms that create everything
2. **[The Furnace Principle](./concepts/02_THE_FURNACE_PRINCIPLE.md)** - How truth becomes meaning becomes care
3. **[The Divide: Me vs Not-Me](./concepts/03_THE_DIVIDE.md)** - The fundamental boundary of existence
4. **[The Structure: Hold → Agent → Hold](./concepts/04_THE_STRUCTURE.md)** - The universal pattern of all work
5. **[The Cycle: Want → Choose → Exist-Now → See → Hold → Move](./concepts/05_THE_CYCLE.md)** - The pulse of life

### 🏗️ Architecture (How Philosophy Becomes Code)

Located in `docs/STUDY_GUIDE/architecture/`:

1. **[Central Services Architecture](./architecture/01_CENTRAL_SERVICES.md)** - The 13 services and how they work
2. **[Governance System](./architecture/02_GOVERNANCE.md)** - Universal policies and enforcement

### 💻 Implementation (Working with the Code)

Located in `docs/STUDY_GUIDE/implementation/`:

1. **[Working with Services](./implementation/01_WORKING_WITH_SERVICES.md)** - How to use central services

### 📖 Reference

- **[Quick Reference Guide](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick lookup for common patterns
- **[START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)** - Entry point and learning path

---

## How to Use This Guide

### For New Developers

1. **Start with [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)** - This is your entry point
2. **Read the Philosophy** - Don't skip this! Understanding "why" makes everything else make sense
3. **Explore the Architecture** - See how philosophy becomes code
4. **Practice with Implementation** - Try the examples yourself

### For Mentors

1. **Point new developers to [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)**
2. **Use the educational callouts** - They explain concepts in a way new developers can understand
3. **Reference the Quick Reference** - Use it as a teaching aid

---

## Educational Callouts

Throughout the guide, you'll see these callouts:

- **🎓 LEARNING**: Core concepts the new developer needs to understand
- **💡 CONCEPT**: Design patterns and architectural principles
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Critical knowledge that prevents problems
- **🎯 PRACTICE**: Industry best practices and standards
- **🚀 MOMENTUM**: Tips to keep the developer motivated

These callouts are designed to make the material accessible to developers with 2 months of experience.

---

## Key Principles

### Philosophy First

**The guide starts with philosophy because understanding "why" makes "how" make sense.**

You can't understand the code without understanding:
- Why The Divide exists (Me vs Not-Me)
- Why The Structure is universal (HOLD → AGENT → HOLD)
- Why The Cycle is the pulse of life (WANT → CHOOSE → EXIST:NOW → SEE → HOLD → MOVE)
- Why The Furnace transforms truth into care

### Concepts Before Implementation

**The guide teaches concepts before showing code.**

This means:
1. First, understand what The Structure is
2. Then, see how services implement it
3. Finally, learn to use services in your code

### Educational Callouts

**Every major concept includes educational callouts.**

These help new developers:
- Understand why something matters
- See how it applies in practice
- Avoid common mistakes
- Stay motivated

## Integration with Existing Documentation

This study guide complements existing documentation:

- **Framework Docs** (`framework/00_THE_FRAMEWORK.md` through `framework/12_THE_RECURSION.md`) - Deep philosophical foundation
- **Architecture Docs** (`framework/architecture/`) - Technical specifications
- **Code Examples** (`.cursor/rules/code_examples.md`) - Implementation templates

**The study guide bridges the gap between philosophy and code.**

---

## Feedback and Contributions

This guide is designed to help others understand Truth Engine. If you find:

- **Concepts that need clarification** - Add educational callouts
- **Missing explanations** - Add new sections
- **Outdated information** - Update the content

**Remember**: The goal is to help new developers understand not just *how* the system works, but *why* it exists and what it means.

## Next Steps

1. **Read [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md)** - Begin your learning journey
2. **Follow the learning path** - Don't skip steps
3. **Practice with examples** - Try the code yourself
4. **Ask questions** - Understanding comes from engagement
