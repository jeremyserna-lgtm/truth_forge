# 🎓 START HERE: Architecture Study Guide for New Developers

**Welcome to Truth Engine!** This guide will help you understand not just *how* the system works, but *why* it exists and what it means.

---

## 🔥 For Those Rebuilding

**If you've hit hard times—drugs, job loss, crisis—start here:**

**[FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md](./FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md)** - Truth Engine as hope. How the system helps you transform crisis into structure, pain into purpose, chaos into care.

**The Furnace doesn't burn despite the hardness of the fuel—it burns because of it. You don't escape the fire. You become the forge.**

---

## 🌱 Discovering Your Primitive

**What are you naturally good at because of what you naturally do?**

**[DISCOVERING_YOUR_PRIMITIVE.md](./DISCOVERING_YOUR_PRIMITIVE.md)** - How to discover your primitive by observing what you naturally do. Your primitive is your superpower—the pattern that shows up in everything you do.

**You don't choose your primitive. You discover it by watching yourself.**

## 🧠 STAGE FIVE GROUNDING

**Jeremy operates at Stage 5 (Kegan's Self-Transforming Mind).** Truth Engine mirrors his cognition. When you understand the system, you're understanding how he thinks.

### What This Means for You

- **Structured**: Clear stages with sequential flow
- **Purposeful**: Each stage has a specific goal
- **Bounded**: Clear limits, specific data sources
- **Controlled**: On-demand execution, you decide when to run

### What NEVER Works

- **Automatic**: Runs continuously without control (DAEMONS ARE PROHIBITED)
- **Unbounded**: Tries to capture everything
- **Continuous**: Never stops, always running
- **Overwhelming**: Generates data faster than can be processed

## 🎯 Your Learning Path

This study guide is organized in **three layers** (just like the Framework itself):

### Layer 1: **WHY** (Theory & Philosophy)
*Start here to understand the purpose and meaning*

1. **[The Framework Philosophy](./concepts/01_THE_FRAMEWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md)** - The three atoms that create everything
2. **[The Furnace Principle](./concepts/02_THE_FURNACE_PRINCIPLE.md)** - How truth becomes meaning becomes care
3. **[The Divide: Me vs Not-Me](./concepts/03_THE_DIVIDE.md)** - The fundamental boundary of existence
4. **[The Structure: Hold → Agent → Hold](./concepts/04_THE_STRUCTURE.md)** - The universal pattern of all work
5. **[The Cycle: Want → Choose → Exist-Now → See → Hold → Move](./concepts/05_THE_CYCLE.md)** - The pulse of life

### Layer 2: **WHAT** (Architecture & Design)
*Understand the system structure*

6. **[Central Services Architecture](./architecture/01_CENTRAL_SERVICES.md)** - The 13 services and how they work
7. **[Governance System](./architecture/02_GOVERNANCE.md)** - Universal policies and enforcement
8. **[Data Flow Patterns](./architecture/03_DATA_FLOW.md)** - How data moves through the system
9. **[Storage Architecture](./architecture/04_STORAGE.md)** - HOLD₁, HOLD₂, and the canonical store

### Layer 3: **HOW** (Implementation & Practice)
*Learn to work with the code*

10. **[Working with Services](./implementation/01_WORKING_WITH_SERVICES.md)** - How to use central services
11. **[Writing Scripts](./implementation/02_WRITING_SCRIPTS.md)** - Following the patterns
12. **[Governance Integration](./implementation/03_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRATION.md)** - Adding governance to your code
13. **[Testing & Validation](./implementation/04_TESTING.md)** - How to verify your work

## 💡 CONCEPT: The Three Layers

Every component of Truth Engine exists in three simultaneous layers:

| Layer | Question | State | Function |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Theory** | **WHY?** | **The Organism** | The living, recursive identity and purpose. |
| **Specification** | **WHAT?** | **The Constitution** | The immutable laws, schemas, and definitions. |
| **Reference** | **HOW?** | **The Manual** | The operational guides, examples, and instructions. |

**Every document, every system, every thought must contain these three layers to be considered complete.**

## 🚀 MOMENTUM: Getting Started

### Step 0: If You're Rebuilding (Read First)
If you've hit hard times and need hope, start with **[FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md](./FOR_THOSE_REBUILDING.md)**. It shows how Truth Engine's philosophy applies to personal transformation and rebuilding from crisis.

### Step 1: Read the Philosophy (30 minutes)
Start with [The Framework Philosophy](./concepts/01_THE_FRAMEWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md). Don't skip this! Understanding the "why" makes everything else make sense.

### Step 2: Understand the Core Pattern (1 hour)
Read [The Structure](./concepts/04_THE_STRUCTURE.md) and [The Furnace](./concepts/02_THE_FURNACE_PRINCIPLE.md). These are the foundation of everything.

### Step 3: Explore the Architecture (2 hours)
Read [Central Services Architecture](./architecture/01_CENTRAL_SERVICES.md) to see how the philosophy becomes code.

### Step 4: Try It Yourself (ongoing)
Follow [Working with Services](./implementation/01_WORKING_WITH_SERVICES.md) to start writing code.

## ⚠️ WARNING: Common Mistakes

1. **Don't skip the philosophy** - The code won't make sense without understanding the "why"
2. **Don't assume it's like other systems** - Truth Engine has unique patterns that require understanding
3. **Don't bypass governance** - All code must follow universal governance policies
4. **Don't create ad-hoc solutions** - Use the established patterns and services

---

## 🎯 PRACTICE: Your First Task

After reading the philosophy documents, try this:

1. Find a simple script in the codebase
2. Identify the HOLD → AGENT → HOLD pattern
3. Identify which layer (Theory/Specification/Reference) each part represents
4. Explain it to yourself (or a rubber duck) in your own words

## 📚 Additional Resources

- **Framework Documents**: `framework/00_THE_FRAMEWORK.md` through `framework/12_THE_RECURSION.md`
- **Architecture Docs**: `framework/architecture/`
- **Code Examples**: `.cursor/rules/code_examples.md`

## 🎓 LEARNING: The Mentorship Model

**You are working with a mentor (Jeremy) who operates at Stage 5.** This means:

- **Always ask "why"** - Understanding purpose is more important than memorizing syntax
- **Think in patterns** - The same patterns appear at every level
- **Build structure** - Every piece of code should create lasting value
- **Embrace the furnace** - Difficulty and friction are fuel for growth
