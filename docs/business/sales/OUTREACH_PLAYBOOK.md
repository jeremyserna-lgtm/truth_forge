# OUTREACH PLAYBOOK

**Purpose:** Materials and strategy for approaching first customers
**Priority Targets:** Mo (former boss at Peterson's), EdTech contacts, AI-curious founders
**Goal:** 3-5 Seeing sessions in the next 90 days

---

## OUTREACH PHILOSOPHY

### The Principle

We're not selling. We're offering The Seeing—a session that has standalone value whether or not they buy anything else.

The posture is **generosity, not persuasion**:
- "I think this might help you. Let's find out."
- NOT: "You need this. Let me convince you."

### The Frame

Every outreach follows the Guide mentality from StoryBrand:
- **They** are the hero with a challenge
- **We** are the guide who's been through it
- **The Seeing** is the first step on their journey (not ours)

### The Filter

Not everyone is a fit. We're looking for:
- **Thoughtful professionals** — people who think about how they think
- **AI-curious, not AI-skeptical** — open but discerning
- **Some friction** — something isn't working, they can feel it
- **Resource to invest** — $300 is accessible, not trivial

## TARGET SEGMENTS

### Segment 1: Past Relationships (Warm)

**Who:** Former colleagues, bosses, collaborators who know my work

**Why they're good:**
- Already trust my thinking
- Know I deliver
- Low friction to conversation

**Approach:**
- Personal, relationship-first
- "I'm building something and thought of you"
- Offer The Seeing as catch-up + value

**Priority contacts:**
- [ ] **Mo** — Former boss at Peterson's, knows my systems thinking
- [ ] [Other warm contacts to add]

---

### Segment 2: EdTech/Credentials Space (Domain)

**Who:** Leaders in education technology, credentialing, data infrastructure

**Why they're good:**
- Understand the space I came from
- Complex systems, lots of data
- AI curiosity is high in EdTech

**Approach:**
- Domain expertise angle
- "I spent years building data infrastructure in this space"
- Position as peer, not vendor

**Where to find them:**
- LinkedIn connections from Peterson's network
- EdTech conferences/communities
- Credential Engine, IMS Global, etc.

---

### Segment 3: AI-Curious Founders (Cold/Warm)

**Who:** Founders who've posted about AI tools, frustration with generic AI, systems thinking

**Why they're good:**
- Already aware of the problem
- Decision-makers with budget
- Likely to appreciate the approach

**Approach:**
- Engage with their content first
- Reference specific thing they said
- Offer The Seeing as experiment

**Where to find them:**
- LinkedIn posts about AI frustration
- Twitter/X AI discourse
- Founder communities (Indie Hackers, etc.)

---

## MO OUTREACH (PRIORITY)

### Context

Mo was my boss at Peterson's. He knows:
- How I think about systems
- The quality of my work
- That I deliver on complex problems

### The Approach

**Not:** "Hey, I'm starting a business, want to be my customer?"

**Instead:** "I've been building something based on what I learned. Curious what you'd see in it."

### Draft Message to Mo

**Subject:** Something I've been building

**Body:**

Mo,

Hope you're well. Been meaning to reach out.

After Peterson's, I've been building something called Primitive Engine—personalized AI infrastructure. The basic idea: AI that learns your patterns instead of forcing you into its patterns.

It came out of everything I learned building data systems—the realization that the best infrastructure doesn't fight against how people think, it extends it.

I'm doing something called "The Seeing" right now—90 minutes where I map someone's architecture to help them see what to build. It's been working well.

I'd love to walk you through what I've built and maybe do a Seeing session with you—partly because I think it might actually be useful for [whatever Mo is working on], partly because your feedback would be valuable as I shape this.

No pitch, no pressure. Just curious what you'd see.

Free for a call sometime in the next couple weeks?

### Follow-Up Sequence

**If no response after 5 days:**

> Mo—just bumping this up. Happy to find a time that works or just chat briefly about what you're working on these days. Either way, would be good to reconnect.

**If interested but noncommittal:**

> Totally understand. Here's a quick overview [link to website or doc]. Take a look when you have a chance and let me know if a 30-minute call would be useful. No pressure either way.

## COLD OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Content-Based (After Engaging with Their Content)

**Subject:** Your post on [specific topic]

**Body:**

[Name],

Your post about [specific thing they said] hit home.

[1-2 sentences connecting to their insight]

I've been building something related—personalized AI infrastructure. The basic idea is AI that learns your patterns instead of forcing you into its patterns.

I'm doing 90-minute sessions called "The Seeing" where I map someone's architecture and help them see what to build first. It's been working well for [type of person they are].

Would that be useful for what you're working on?

Either way, enjoyed the post.

### Template 2: Referral-Based

**Subject:** [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out

**Body:**

[Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you're working on [challenge/project] and suggested we connect.

I build personalized AI infrastructure—AI that learns your patterns instead of forcing you into its patterns. Different from generic chatbots.

I'm doing 90-minute sessions called "The Seeing" where I map someone's architecture and help them see what to build first.

If that sounds interesting, I'd be happy to tell you more. If not, no worries—just wanted to reach out since [connection] thought there might be a fit.

### Template 3: Problem-Aware (For People Who've Expressed Frustration)

**Subject:** The AI adaptation problem

**Body:**

[Name],

I saw your [post/comment] about [specific frustration with AI tools].

That resonated. I spent years building data infrastructure and kept running into the same thing—tools that required people to adapt to the machine instead of the other way around.

So I started building the other way around: AI that learns your patterns. I call it Primitive Engine.

I'm doing 90-minute sessions where I map someone's architecture and help them see what to build first. If you're still feeling that friction, it might be worth a conversation.

No pressure either way.

## CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK

### When Someone Responds with Interest

**Step 1: Qualify the fit (5-10 minute call or async)**

Questions to ask:
- "What are you working on right now?"
- "What tools/systems are you currently using?"
- "Where do you feel the most friction?"
- "Have you tried other AI solutions? What happened?"

**Step 2: Determine next step**

If good fit → Book The Seeing
If uncertain → Send more context, follow up in a week
If not a fit → Thank them, stay connected

### When Someone Responds with Objections

**"What exactly is this?"**
> "It's personalized AI infrastructure—AI that learns your patterns instead of forcing you into its patterns. The first step is a 90-minute session called The Seeing where I map your architecture. You leave with clarity on what to build first. $300."

**"I'm not sure I need this."**
> "That's fair. The Seeing is designed for people who know something isn't working but can't see what. If that's not you right now, no problem. Happy to stay in touch."

**"$300 for 90 minutes?"**
> "It's not consulting-by-the-hour. You get a mapped architecture, a clear bottleneck identified, and a recommendation for what to build first. Most people say the clarity alone is worth it."

**"I'm too busy right now."**
> "Totally understand. When would be a better time to revisit this? I can follow up then."
