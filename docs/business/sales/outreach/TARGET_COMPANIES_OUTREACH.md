# Target Companies & Outreach Strategy

**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Source**: Clara conversation Aug 19, 2025 + Furnace Principle
**Purpose**: Actionable outreach list with decision makers and messaging

---

## Top Priority Targets (Start Here)

### 1. Renaissance Learning
**Why**: Strong data culture, real-time insights work (aligned with Truth Engine)
**Decision Makers to Find**:
- CTO / VP Engineering
- Chief Data Officer / VP Data
- VP Product (assessment analytics)

**The Hook**: "You're deploying AI-powered adaptive assessment. How do you verify the AI isn't hallucinating student capabilities?"

---

### 2. Ellucian (Higher Ed SIS/ERP)
**Why**: Cloud migrations + AI roadmap, large customer base with data governance needs
**Decision Makers to Find**:
- CTO / Chief Technology Officer
- VP Data & Analytics
- VP AI Strategy

**The Hook**: "You're migrating institutions to cloud + AI. How do you preserve 50+ years of institutional memory during the transition?"

---

### 3. Civitas Learning
**Why**: Student success analytics - literally prescriptive AI workflows (exactly what Truth Engine addresses)
**Decision Makers to Find**:
- Chief Analytics Officer
- VP Data Science
- CTO

**The Hook**: "Your prescriptive workflows make recommendations. How do you verify AI confidence before advising students to drop/add courses?"

---

### 4. GoGuardian (K-12 Safety + Analytics)
**Why**: Data governance is hot topic (per your notes), classroom management at scale
**Decision Makers to Find**:
- Chief Product Officer
- VP Data Governance
- CTO

**The Hook**: "You're protecting students with AI. How do you audit what the AI flagged vs. what it missed?"

---

### 5. Clever (K-12 Identity/SSO)
**Why**: District-scale data plumbing - you understand this infrastructure deeply
**Decision Makers to Find**:
- VP Data Infrastructure
- Chief Architect
- CTO

**The Hook**: "You're the data highway for K-12. What happens when districts need to verify truth across 50+ integrated apps?"

---

## The Outreach Message Template

### Subject Line Options:
1. "Built organizational epistemology in 108 days - relevant to [Company]?"
2. "Truth verification for AI deployment - [Company] use case"
3. "How I solved confident hallucinations (and can do it for you)"

### Message Body (Adapt per company):

---

**Hi [Name],**

I built something you might need.

**Context**: I'm Jeremy Serna - former strategic leader at Petersons (EdTech). In 108 days this summer, I built an organizational epistemology system while recovering from crisis. Not academic theory - actual running code.

**What I built**:
- Multi-tier truth architecture (Ground Truth, Derived Truth, Hypotheses)
- Provenance tracking (who said what when with what confidence)
- AI output verification (Tier 1 = verified, Tier 3 = flagged as uncertain)
- 240,000+ data points indexed, queryable, auditable

**Why this matters to [Company]**:
[Company-specific problem - see hooks above]

**The demonstration**: I can show you this live in BigQuery. Real queries, real architecture, real results. 15 minutes.

**What I'm asking**: Would you be open to seeing what I built? If it's relevant, we talk about how I could build it for [Company]. If not, you've seen something unique.

I'm not sending you a resume. **I'm offering to solve a problem most companies don't know how to name.**

Let me know.

### Alternative (More Direct):

**Hi [Name],**

Quick question: How do you verify your AI isn't hallucinating before making student/institutional decisions?

I built a system that solves this. Multi-tier confidence, provenance tracking, queryable architecture. Not a pitch deck - actual running code in BigQuery.

Built it in 108 days while questioning what was real in my own life. Now it's ready for organizations facing the same problem.

15-minute live demo if you're interested.

## Outreach Channels

### LinkedIn (Primary)
- Direct message to decision makers
- Connection request + note (150 char limit): "Built truth verification for AI deployment. Relevant to [Company]'s work?"
- InMail if available

### Email (Secondary)
- Find via company website, LinkedIn, RocketReach, Hunter.io
- Subject: See template above
- Body: Professional version of message

### Company Contact Forms (Tertiary)
- Use if LinkedIn/email not available
- Frame as "Solution inquiry" not "Job application"

---

## How to Find Decision Makers

### LinkedIn Search Patterns:
```
site:linkedin.com/in/ "Renaissance Learning" (CTO OR "Chief Technology Officer" OR "VP Data")
site:linkedin.com/in/ "Ellucian" ("Chief Data Officer" OR "VP Analytics" OR "VP AI")
site:linkedin.com/in/ "Civitas Learning" (CTO OR "Chief Analytics" OR "VP Data Science")
```

### What to Look For:
- Tenure (2+ years = understands company pain points)
- Activity (posts about AI, data, EdTech transformation)
- Connections (2nd degree = can request intro)

### Red Flags (Skip):
- Brand new to role (<6 months = still learning, can't buy yet)
- Heavy recruiter language (not decision maker)
- No activity (ghost LinkedIn account)

## The Positioning (Reminder)

**You are NOT**:
- Looking for a job
- Asking for a meeting
- Sending a resume

**You ARE**:
- Offering to solve a problem
- Demonstrating something they've never seen
- Creating gravity (they come to you)

**The frame**: "I built this. It's relevant to your problem. Want to see it?"

**NOT**: "I'm qualified for roles at your company. Can we talk?"

---

## Next Steps (Today)

1. ✅ Extract target company list (DONE)
2. Find 3-5 decision makers at top 5 companies (LinkedIn search)
3. Send first 5 outreach messages (use template above)
4. Track in spreadsheet
5. Set reminder: Follow up in 5 days if no response

**Status**: Target list ready. Decision maker identification in progress. Outreach messaging complete.

**The furnace is ready. Now show them the heat.**
