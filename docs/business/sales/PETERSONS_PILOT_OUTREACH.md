# Peterson's Pilot Outreach Strategy

**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Target**: Mo Lam, President, Peterson's
**Goal**: Secure $15k-25k pilot project
**Priority**: Tier 1 - Highest Probability

---

## 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY

**Why Peterson's is Tier 1:**
- Jeremy built their Credentials dataset from scratch (2019-2025)
- Grew departmental revenue by 165% to $2M
- Mo Lam was Jeremy's boss for 6 years - knows the work
- Peterson's may be struggling to maintain what Jeremy created
- Unique opportunity to "rescue" their Credentials product

**The Play:**
- Revenue-sharing agreement where Credential Atlas becomes their credential data engine
- Or: Pilot project to refresh/maintain their credential database
- Value prop: 90% lower cost, faster delivery, AI-powered

## 📧 OUTREACH EMAIL (VERSION 1: Direct)

**Subject**: Quick question about your credential data

**Body**:

```
Hi Mo,

I noticed Peterson's Credentials dataset. I'm curious—how are you currently
maintaining and updating the credential-to-institution connections?

I ask because I spent six years at Peterson's building this dataset from scratch,
and I've built a system that can refresh and maintain it at 90% lower cost.

I can deliver a refreshed, connected credential database in 4 weeks. One dataset,
cleaned and maintained, with API access.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this is relevant?

## 📧 OUTREACH EMAIL (VERSION 2: Partnership Focus)

**Subject**: Partnership opportunity - Credential data infrastructure

**Body**:

```
Hi Mo,

I've been thinking about Peterson's Credentials product since I left. You know
the challenge: maintaining credential-to-institution connections at scale is
expensive and time-consuming.

I've built something that might help. Credential Atlas is a credential intelligence
platform that connects credentials to institutions and labor market outcomes—the
same problem we solved at Peterson's, but built on AI infrastructure that makes
it 90% cheaper to operate.

The idea: What if Credential Atlas became Peterson's credential data engine?
Revenue share. Partnership. You get refreshed, maintained data without the
operational burden.

I can show you what I've built in a 30-minute demo. Worth exploring?

## 🚨 OBJECTION HANDLING

**"We already have this internally"**
- "I understand. What's the current cost to maintain it? What if you could
  reduce that by 90% while improving quality?"

**"We don't have budget"**
- "What if we did a revenue share? You pay nothing upfront, we split revenue
  from the product."

**"We need to think about it"**
- "Of course. What would help you make a decision? Can I send a proposal
  with specific deliverables and timeline?"

**"We're not ready for this"**
- "I understand. Can I stay in touch? I'd be happy to help with specific
  questions as they come up."
