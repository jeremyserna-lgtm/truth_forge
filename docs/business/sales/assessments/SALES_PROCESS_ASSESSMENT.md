## DISCOVERY CALL FRAMEWORK

### Credential Atlas Discovery (15-30 minutes)

**Objectives:**
1. Understand their current state
2. Identify their pain points
3. Qualify if Credential Atlas solves their problem
4. Set up proposal if qualified

**Current State Questions:**
- "How are you currently connecting credential data to outcomes?"
- "What systems hold your credential data today?"
- "Who uses this data and for what decisions?"

**Pain Points Questions:**
- "What's frustrating about the current approach?"
- "How much time does this take today?"
- "What happens when you don't have this data?"

**Future State Questions:**
- "If you had credential-to-outcome data, what would you do with it?"
- "Who would use this?"
- "What's the timeline for needing this?"

**Qualification Questions:**
- "Who else would be involved in this decision?"
- "Is there budget allocated for this?"
- "What would success look like in 90 days?"

**Demo (If Requested):**
- Show BigQuery credential database structure
- Show sample credential-to-outcome mapping
- Show what deliverable looks like
- Keep to 10 minutes max

---

### The Seeing Discovery (Built Into The Session)

**The Seeing IS the discovery.** You don't have a separate discovery call—the $300 session is:
1. Discovery (what's their architecture)
2. Diagnosis (where are the gaps)
3. Recommendation (what to do next)

**The Seeing Session Structure (90 min):**

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Opening** | 10 min | Context gathering, what they want |
| **Observation** | 40 min | Map their architecture, identify patterns |
| **Synthesis** | 20 min | Identify gaps, leaks, opportunities |
| **Recommendation** | 20 min | First move, whether Pilot makes sense |

**What You Deliver:**
- Architecture map (documented)
- Gaps/leaks identified
- First move recommendation
- Clear yes/no on whether deeper work makes sense

**What You DON'T Do:**
- Fix anything (that's The Pilot)
- Build anything (that's The Pilot)
- Make promises about outcomes (that's predicated on their action)

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Credential Atlas Objections

**"This is too expensive"**
> "I understand budget is a consideration. Let me ask—what's the cost of not having this data? How many hours per month does your team spend cobbling credential data together manually? At $50/hour, that's [X] per month. This project pays for itself in [Y] months."

**Alternative:** "What scope would fit your budget? We can start smaller and expand."

**"We can build this ourselves"**
> "You absolutely could. The question is: should you? A data engineer costs $150K+/year. I can deliver this in 4 weeks for $15K. If you like it, you can either keep using it or hire someone to maintain it. Either way, you get the data faster."

**"We need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What would help you make a decision? Is there information I haven't provided? Is there someone else who needs to be involved?"

**"We're working with [Competitor]"**
> "Great—what are they providing? I'm not trying to replace your existing setup. Credential Atlas specifically connects credential data to outcomes, which is often complementary to what [Competitor] provides."

**"Can we do a pilot first?"**
> "The $15K project IS the pilot. It's scoped to prove value without a large commitment. If it works, we discuss ongoing access. If it doesn't, you're out $15K and 4 weeks—not 6 figures and a year."

---

### The Services Objections

**"$300 for 90 minutes seems expensive"**
> "You're not paying for 90 minutes. You're paying for what I see in those 90 minutes. I've spent 6 years mapping organizational architecture. That hour and a half gives you clarity that would take weeks to find on your own—if you could find it at all."

**"Can't I just get the Pilot without The Seeing?"**
> "No. The Seeing tells us what to build. Without it, I'd be guessing—and you'd be paying for my guesses. The Seeing protects both of us."

**"$3,000 for one week seems like a lot"**
> "It's one mechanism that will run without you pushing it. How much is your time worth? If this saves you 5 hours a week at $100/hour, it pays for itself in 6 weeks. And it runs forever."

**"$5,000/month is more than I pay for [other service]"**
> "What does that service build for you? The Stewardship isn't advice—it's infrastructure. I maintain a living system. Coaches give you motivation. I give you machinery."

**"I'm not sure I need this"**
> "That's exactly what The Seeing is for. $300 to find out. If we discover you don't need deeper work, you've spent $300 and 90 minutes. You'll still have the architecture map."
