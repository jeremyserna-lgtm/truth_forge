## HANDLING ISSUES

### If Delivery Will Be Late

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| Proactive communication | As soon as delay is known |
| Explain reason, new timeline | Same communication |
| Offer compensation if significant | If >1 week delay |

### If Customer Is Unhappy

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Listen fully, don't interrupt |
| 2 | Acknowledge their concern |
| 3 | Ask what success looks like |
| 4 | Propose specific remedy |
| 5 | Follow through completely |

### If The Seeing Doesn't Land

If client leaves confused or dissatisfied:
1. Offer follow-up call (free)
2. Ask what would have helped
3. Learn for next session
4. No pressure on Pilot—this validates the process

### If The Pilot Mechanism Doesn't Work

If mechanism isn't breathing at delivery:
1. Extend by 2-3 days at no cost
2. Identify what's blocking
3. Fix or acknowledge limitation
4. Document for future Pilots

### If Stewardship Client Churns

When client cancels:
1. 30-day notice honored
2. Graceful shutdown performed (organism death protocol)
3. Documentation of final state
4. Legacy preserved for potential return
5. Exit interview for learning

### The Services Expansion

| From | To | Trigger |

[Company] can now [specific capability gained].
```

### The Services Case Study

```markdown
# Case Study: [Client]

## The Situation
[Client] was [specific struggle - pushing systems, manual processes, etc.]

## The Seeing
In 90 minutes, we mapped [what we found]. The architecture revealed [insight].

## The Pilot
We built [specific mechanism] that [what it does]. It breathes:
- Inhale: [input]
- Process: [what happens]
- Exhale: [output]

## The Result
[Client] no longer [what they used to have to do].
The system holds the weight.
