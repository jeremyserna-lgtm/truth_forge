# Product Focus Decision

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Updated:** Incorporated Services product line and organism architecture
**Purpose:** Document the complete product hierarchy and focus

---

## THE DECISION

**Primary Revenue Product:** Credential Atlas (B2B)
**Primary Market:** EdTech companies and State Workforce Boards
**First Customer:** Mo Lam / Peterson's

**Active Service Product:** The Services (Consulting → Infrastructure)
**Use Case:** Non-Credential-Atlas fits, custom infrastructure needs

**Future Product:** Proof of State (B2C)
**Gate:** Wait until 3+ Credential Atlas customers, $50K+ revenue

---

## The Product Hierarchy

| Priority | Product | Target | Role | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|------|--------|
| **PRIMARY** | Credential Atlas | EdTech, State Workforce | Revenue generator | ACTIVE |
| **ACTIVE** | The Services | Anyone needing infrastructure | Entry point, custom work | ACTIVE |
| Secondary | Truth Engine (Enterprise) | AI governance | Infrastructure (powers CA) | INTERNAL |
| Future | Proof of State (B2C) | Individuals, Hiring Entities | Later, when proven | WAITING |

**Rule:** All external messaging focuses on Credential Atlas OR The Services depending on fit. Truth Engine is mentioned as infrastructure only. Proof of State waits.

---

## The Unified Capability

All products express one capability:

**CLAIM → VERIFICATION ENGINE → TRUTH**

Or in organism terms:

**CHAOS → FURNACE → ORDER (that breathes)**

| Expression | Domain | Input | Output |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Credential Atlas** | B2B | Credential registries | Credential-to-outcome maps |
| **The Services** | Consulting | Client architecture | Living systems |
| **Proof of State** | B2C | Conversation history | Cognitive verification score |

## The Organism Architecture

All products share the same underlying architecture:

### The Spark
Permission to exist.
- Credential Atlas: Contract signed = Spark granted
- The Services: Engagement begins = Spark granted
- Proof of State: User signs up = Spark granted

### The Heartbeat
Regular vital checks.
- Credential Atlas: Weekly status updates during project
- The Stewardship: Monthly health reports
- Proof of State: Continuous score updates

### The Breath
HOLD₁ → AGENT → HOLD₂
- Credential Atlas: Receive data → Process → Deliver dataset
- The Services: Receive architecture → Process → Deliver system
- Proof of State: Receive conversations → Process → Deliver score

### The Molt
Shed and grow when truth outgrows container.
- Credential Atlas: Scope expansion after initial project
- The Stewardship: System evolution support
- Proof of State: Score recalculation as user grows

### Graceful Death
Legacy preserved when engagement ends.
- All products: Contract ends → System lives independently or dies gracefully
- No zombie infrastructure. No abandoned code. Life or dignified death.

## Decision Rules

### When to Sell Credential Atlas
- Prospect is EdTech company or State Workforce Board
- They have credential data they need connected to outcomes
- Budget is $15K+ for project work
- Timeline is weeks, not months

### When to Sell The Services
- Prospect needs custom infrastructure
- Not a credential data problem specifically
- Interested in "systems that breathe"
- Entry point: Always start with The Seeing

### When to Mention Truth Engine
- Only as infrastructure that powers Credential Atlas
- "Powered by our Truth Engine infrastructure—51.8M entities"
- Never as a standalone product

### When to Mention Proof of State
- Not yet. Wait for gates to clear.
- Exception: If B2B customer asks about verifying people, note it's coming.

*Product hierarchy defined. Credential Atlas is primary. The Services is active. Proof of State waits. All products share organism architecture.*
