# Customer Acquisition Assessment

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Updated:** Added Services acquisition channel alongside Credential Atlas
**Purpose:** Document how we get customers for both product lines

---

## CURRENT STATE

| Component | Credential Atlas | The Services | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Target list | 40+ companies | TBD | ✅ / ⚠️ |
| Email templates | Ready | Not created | ✅ / ❌ |
| Proposal templates | Ready | Ready | ✅ |
| Demo/session script | Documented | Documented | ✅ |
| **Outreach sent** | Zero | Zero | ❌ |
| **Tracking system** | No CRM | No CRM | ❌ |

**The gap:** Strategy complete. Execution zero.

## ACQUISITION CHANNELS BY PRODUCT

### Credential Atlas Acquisition

| Channel | Method | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Primary** | Direct outreach to EdTech/State | Ready, not started |
| **Secondary** | Inbound (Google, LinkedIn) | Active (Ashutosh) |
| **Future** | Referral from customers | After first close |

### The Services Acquisition

| Channel | Method | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Primary** | Word of mouth / network | Passive |
| **Secondary** | Content (eventually) | Not started |
| **Entry** | $300 Seeing session | Ready to deliver |
| **Cross-sell** | From Credential Atlas clients | After first CA close |

## WHY OUTREACH HASN'T STARTED

### Honest Assessment

| Blocker | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Need business email" | Can send from gmail initially |
| "Need FEIN" | Not required for outreach |
| "Need website" | LinkedIn + one-pager is enough |
| "Need perfect messaging" | Current messaging is good enough |
| "Need more prep" | Preparation is complete |

**The truth:** Nothing blocks outreach except doing it.

## CREDENTIAL ATLAS: OUTREACH SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Opening (Day 1)

**Subject:** Quick question about your credential data

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is building [specific product]. I'm curious—how are you
currently connecting credential data to institutional information and
labor market outcomes?

I ask because I spent six years at Peterson's operationalizing education
data, and I've seen most companies either cobble this together manually
or go without.

I can connect your credential data to institutional context and labor
market outcomes in 4 weeks. One dataset, cleaned and maintained.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this is relevant for you?

—Jeremy
```

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your credential data

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about credential data. I've attached a one-pager
that shows what this looks like.

If credential-to-outcome mapping is something you're thinking about,
I'd be happy to show you what we've built.

—Jeremy
```

### Email 3: Final (Day 10)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your credential data

```
Hi [Name],

Last note from me on this. If connecting credential data to outcomes
isn't a priority right now, no worries.

If it becomes relevant later, I'm at jeremy.serna@gmail.com.

—Jeremy
```

## THE SERVICES: ACQUISITION APPROACH

### Primary: Network & Word of Mouth

The Services clients come from:
- Friends who know what Jeremy does
- Referrals from satisfied clients
- People who see organism-based work and want it

### Entry Point: The Seeing

Everyone starts with The Seeing ($300, 90 min):
- Low barrier to try
- No commitment to more
- Clear deliverable (architecture map)

### Outreach Template (When Needed)

**Subject:** Something's not working. Let me map it.

```
Hi [Name],

[Personal context - how I know them or what I noticed]

I spend most of my time mapping architecture that people can't see about
themselves. 90 minutes, $300. You leave with a map of how you actually
work, where you're leaking energy, and what should hold weight but doesn't.

If something's stuck and you don't know why, this is what I do.

If you want to book a session: [link/email]

—Jeremy
```

### Cross-Sell from Credential Atlas

After Credential Atlas delivery:

```
Now that you have the data, you might want systems that act on it
automatically. That's what I do through my Services practice.

Would a Seeing session help map what else could be built?
```
