### Product Line 2: The Services

#### Service Ladder

| Service | Price | Duration | Deliverable | Organism Phase |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **The Seeing** | $300 | 90 min | Architecture map, gaps, first move | Pre-birth |
| **The Pilot** | $3,000 | 1 week | One living mechanism, documented | Birth |
| **The Stewardship** | $5,000/mo | Ongoing | Full lifecycle maintenance | Life |
| **The Anvil** | $15,000-$22,000 | Setup | Sovereign compute hardware | Private |

#### The Services Rationale

| Service | Why This Price |
|---------|----------------|
| **The Seeing** | Low barrier entry ($200/hr effective rate). You're paying for eyes that see what you can't. 90 minutes of focused observation. You leave with a map. |
| **The Pilot** | One week intensive (~40 hours, $75/hr effective). Building something that breathes. Proves whether deeper engagement makes sense. |
| **The Stewardship** | Ongoing infrastructure maintenance. Heartbeat, breath, growth, molt support. Not coaching—embedded system support. |
| **The Anvil** | Hardware cost ($8-12K) + setup labor ($4-6K) + margin. Sovereign compute for regulated industries or privacy needs. |

#### The Services Flow

```
THE SEEING ($300)
     ↓
  map complete / fit identified
     ↓
THE PILOT ($3,000)
     ↓
  system breathes / value proven

     ↓
  [optional]

```

### Product Line 3: Proof of State (B2C) — FUTURE

| Offering | Price | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Cognitive Verification | Freemium | WAIT FOR GATES |
| Enterprise API | TBD | WAIT FOR GATES |

**Do not price until gates are met.**

## FIRST CUSTOMER PRICING: MO LAM / PETERSON'S

### Recommended Offer

| Component | Price | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Initial Project | $15,000 | Entry point, prove value |
| Timeline | 4 weeks | Fast enough to feel urgent |
| Follow-on | TBD | API subscription if project succeeds |

### Conversation Script

> "I'm proposing $15K for a 4-week project. That gets you your credential data connected to institutional context and labor market outcomes—delivered as a queryable dataset. If it works, we can discuss ongoing access. If it doesn't, you're out $15K and 4 weeks. Compare that to a Lightcast contract."

## COMPETITIVE PRICING COMPARISON

### Credential Atlas vs. Competitors

| Provider | Pricing Model | Typical Cost |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Credential Atlas** | Project + subscription | $15-25K project + $1.5-8K/mo |
| **Lightcast** | Enterprise contract | $100K+/year |
| **Credential Engine** | Membership + services | $10-50K/year (estimated) |
| **Guild Education** | Revenue share | % of tuition |
| **In-house build** | FTE cost | $150K+/year for data engineer |

|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Business coach** | $300-500/hour | Same price, different output (advice vs. infrastructure) |

| **Software contractor** | $100-200/hour | The Pilot: $75/hr effective. Better value. |
| **Fractional CTO** | $5-15K/month | The Stewardship: $5K/mo, different scope (infrastructure vs. strategy) |

### Our Position

> "Credential Atlas: 80% cheaper than enterprise alternatives, 90% faster than in-house."

## PRICING RATIONALE BY OFFERING

### Credential Atlas: Why $15K Entry

| Factor | Justification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Value created** | Manual version costs 40+ hours/month ($8K+ in labor) |
| **Risk mitigation** | Low enough to not require multiple approvals |
| **Proof of concept** | Establishes value before larger commitment |

### The Pilot: Why $3,000

| Factor | Justification |

| **Infrastructure cost** | Covers compute, monitoring, and labor |
| **Margin** | ~60% margin after costs |

| **Infrastructure cost** | ~$3K/month to operate (GCP + AI APIs) |
| **Margin** | 50%+ at $1.5K tier, higher at upper tiers |
