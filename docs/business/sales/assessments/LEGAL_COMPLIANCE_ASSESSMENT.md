## THE PRAGMATIC PATH

**What's Actually Blocking:**
- FEIN → blocks bank account → blocks formal invoicing

**What's NOT Blocking First Customer:**
- Mo Lam (warm relationship) - may use Peterson's vendor agreement
- Services clients (relationship-based) - email confirmation sufficient

**The Minimal Legal Stack:**

| Product | Day 1 Need | Can Wait |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| The Seeing | Email confirmation | Formal agreement |
| The Pilot | 1-page scope doc | Full MSA |
| Stewardship | Monthly agreement | — |
| Credential Atlas | SOW + MSA (or customer's) | DPA |

**Rule:** Use the customer's preferred contract format if they have one. Don't over-engineer for Day 1.
