# PRICING FRAMEWORK
## Convergent Architecture Pricing Model

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Purpose:** Define pricing structure aligned with philosophical foundations

---

## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

### The Three Principles

**1. Value-Based, Not Time-Based**
Price reflects transformation delivered, not hours spent. A 90-minute Seeing that changes someone's trajectory is worth more than 40 hours of undifferentiated consulting.

**2. Confidence-Calibrated**
Epistemic humility means honest pricing. Where we're certain, we price with certainty. Where we're uncertain, we structure for shared risk.

**3. Reciprocity-Honoring**
Two-way value deserves two-way benefit. Clients who contribute to Framework evolution receive tangible benefit.

## THE SEEING: Pricing

### Core Offering

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Duration** | 90-minute session + preparation + synthesis |
| **Deliverables** | Pattern Architecture Map, Confidence Landscape, Extension Points, Recorded session |
| **Total time investment** | ~4-6 hours (your time) |

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Essential** | $3,500 | Session + Pattern Map + Recording | Individuals exploring fit |
| **Standard** | $5,500 | Essential + Confidence Landscape + Extension Points + 30-min follow-up | Primary offering |
| **Deep** | $8,500 | Standard + Second session + Written synthesis report + Build recommendations | Complex situations, organizations |

### The Reciprocity Option

> "If you're willing to contribute a case study or pattern documentation back to the Framework (anonymized, with your approval), take $500 off any tier."

This makes reciprocal value explicit and tangible.

### Founding Client Pricing (First 10 Clients)

## BUILDS: Pricing

### Pricing Model: Scoped + Confidence-Based

Builds are priced based on:
1. **Scope complexity** (what's being built)
2. **Pattern availability** (have we built this before?)
3. **Confidence level** (how certain are we of success?)

### Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Description | Price Range | Timeline |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Focused** | Single-purpose AI system (e.g., one workflow, one integration) | $8,000 - $15,000 | 2-4 weeks |
| **Integrated** | Multi-component system (e.g., connected workflows, multiple integrations) | $15,000 - $35,000 | 4-8 weeks |
| **Comprehensive** | Full infrastructure build (e.g., complete AI layer for business operations) | $35,000 - $75,000 | 8-16 weeks |
| **Enterprise** | Organization-wide transformation | $75,000+ | Custom |

### Pattern Availability Modifier

| Pattern Status | Modifier | Rationale |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **Established** (built 3+ times) | -15% | Efficiency from accumulated patterns |
| **Emerging** (built 1-2 times) | Standard | Learning still occurring |
| **Novel** (first time) | +20% | R&D investment required |

### Confidence-Based Structure

| Confidence Level | Pricing Structure | Payment Terms |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **High** (proven pattern, clear requirements) | Fixed price | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery |
| **Medium** (likely success, some unknowns) | Range price (±20%) | 40% upfront, 40% at milestone, 20% on delivery |
| **Low** (experimental, significant unknowns) | Discovery phase first ($3-5K), then re-scope | Discovery paid upfront, Build scoped after |

### Example Build Pricing

**Focused Build: Personal Knowledge System**
- Scope: AI-powered second brain for capturing, organizing, retrieving personal knowledge
- Pattern status: Emerging (built twice before)
- Confidence: High
- **Price: $12,000 fixed**
- Timeline: 3 weeks

**Integrated Build: Client Communication System**
- Scope: AI layer for email triage, response drafting, follow-up scheduling, CRM integration
- Pattern status: Novel (first time in this configuration)
- Confidence: Medium
- **Price: $28,000 - $34,000 range**
- Timeline: 6 weeks

**Comprehensive Build: Operations Intelligence Layer**
- Scope: Full AI infrastructure for solo consultancy (knowledge management, client communication, content creation, business intelligence)
- Pattern status: Emerging
- Confidence: Medium
- **Price: $55,000 - $65,000 range**
- Timeline: 12 weeks

### Build Reciprocity Option

> "If the patterns we develop together can be documented and added to the Framework's pattern library (anonymized, with your approval), take 10% off the Build price."

---

## STEWARDSHIP: Pricing

### Philosophy

Stewardship is ongoing care, not maintenance. It's the relationship layer that:
- Sustains transformation (neuroscience)
- Monitors confidence drift (epistemic humility)
- Enables reciprocal learning (indigenous wisdom)
- Tends the ecosystem (biomimicry)

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Monthly Price | What's Included | Best For |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Tending** | $1,500/mo | Monthly check-in (30 min), monitoring, minor adjustments, async support (24hr response) | Stable systems, light touch |
| **Cultivation** | $2,500/mo | Bi-weekly check-ins, proactive optimization, priority support (same-day), quarterly ecosystem assessment | Active growth, evolving needs |
| **Partnership** | $4,500/mo | Weekly sessions, continuous optimization, dedicated support, monthly strategic review, unlimited adjustments | Mission-critical systems, deep collaboration |

### Commitment Terms

| Commitment | Monthly Rate | Effective Discount |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Month-to-month | Standard | — |
| 6-month commitment | -10% | Relationship investment |
| 12-month commitment | -15% | Partnership alignment |

### Stewardship Bundled with Build

**Recommended:** Bundle Stewardship with every Build.

| Build Tier | Included Stewardship | Duration |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Focused | Tending tier | 2 months included |
| Integrated | Tending tier | 3 months included |
| Comprehensive | Cultivation tier | 3 months included |

After included period, client can continue at standard Stewardship rates.

### The Learning Loop Benefit

Clients in Stewardship longer than 6 months:
- Get priority access to Framework improvements
- Receive learnings from other client patterns (anonymized)
- Contribute to and benefit from the knowledge flywheel

## PRICING COMMUNICATION

### How to Present Pricing

**Don't:** Send a price list. Let them pick.

**Do:** After The Seeing (or discovery conversation), provide a specific recommendation with rationale:

> "Based on what we discovered, I recommend the Integrated Build tier with Cultivation Stewardship. Here's why: [specific reasoning tied to their patterns]. This is a Medium-confidence engagement because [honest assessment of unknowns]. The range is $24,000 - $29,000 for the Build, plus $2,500/month for ongoing Stewardship. If you're open to contributing a case study, that brings the Build to $21,600 - $26,100."

### Handling Price Objections

**Objection:** "That's more than I expected."

**Response:** "I understand. Let me be clear about what you're paying for: this isn't hours of my time—it's the convergent architecture that seven independent disciplines discovered, applied to your specific patterns. The Build will be self-healing, confidence-calibrated, and designed to extend how you already think. If the investment doesn't feel right, I'd rather we find the right scope than force a fit. What would feel right to you?"

**Objection:** "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Response:** "I can scope differently—maybe a Focused Build that addresses your most pressing need, with room to expand later. What I won't do is reduce quality or cut corners on the care that makes this work. Let's look at what a $12,000 Focused Build could accomplish for you."

**Objection:** "Other AI consultants charge less."

**Response:** "They probably do. What I offer is different: Stage 5 pattern recognition that most people can't provide, systems designed biomimetically to self-heal, and honest acknowledgment of what I'm confident about versus uncertain about. If you want a cheaper option, I can recommend some. But if you want convergent architecture built from lived transformation, this is the investment."

## PRICING INTEGRITY

### What We Never Do

- **Discount based on urgency or pressure.** The price is the price.
- **Negotiate against ourselves.** If they want less, scope less.
- **Promise what we can't deliver.** Epistemic humility means honest assessment.
- **Charge premium for uncertain outcomes.** Confidence calibration is real.

### What We Always Do

- **Honor reciprocity.** If they contribute, they benefit.
- **Explain value clearly.** They should understand what they're paying for.
- **Scope to fit.** If budget is real constraint, find the right scope.
- **Protect the relationship.** No sale is worth a damaged relationship.
