## SALES PROCESS

### The Funnel

```
AWARENESS → RESONANCE → DISCOVERY → PROPOSAL → DECISION → ONBOARDING
```

### Discovery Call (30-45 min)

1. **Opening (5 min):** Set mutual exploration frame
2. **Their Story (15-20 min):** Listen for patterns, Stage 4 indicators
3. **Reflection (5 min):** Mirror back what you see
4. **Fit Assessment (5-10 min):** Honest recommendation or redirect
5. **Close (5 min):** Clear next step, no pressure

**Key questions:**
- "What's going on that brought you here?"
- "What have you tried that hasn't worked?"
- "What would be different if this worked?"

**Fit indicators:**
- ✅ Stage 4 moving toward Stage 5
- ✅ Values relationship over transaction
- ✅ Seeking transformation, not just automation
- ❌ Wants magic bullet
- ❌ Purely transactional
- ❌ Not ready for change

### Proposal Timeline
- Send within 24-48 hours
- Follow up once at 7 days
- "Closing the loop" at 14 days
- Expires at 30 days

## OBJECTION RESPONSES

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"More than expected"** | "Let me be clear about value... If investment doesn't feel right, let's find right scope." |
| **"Can you discount?"** | "I don't discount, but I can scope differently. What budget works?" |
| **"Need to compare options"** | "That makes sense. What would help you compare?" |
| **"Not sure I'm ready"** | "What would need to be true for you to be ready?" |
| **"Been burned before"** | "What happened? Here's what I do differently..." |
| **"Why more than others?"** | "This is convergent architecture—patterns seven disciplines confirmed—not one person's methodology." |

## CONVERGENT POSITIONING

### The One-Liner
> "Evolutionary AI infrastructure built through relationship, honest about uncertainty, designed for people still becoming."

### The Elevator Pitch
> "I build AI that grows with you. Most AI forces you to adapt to the machine—mine learns your patterns. I map your cognitive architecture, build systems that extend how you already think, and enter into ongoing relationship to tend what we create together. The AI knows what it doesn't know, adapts like a living system, and through reciprocity, your insights make it smarter while it makes you more capable."

### When Explaining the Approach
> "What I offer isn't a methodology I invented—it's convergent architecture that seven independent disciplines discovered because transformation has universal structure. Biology calls it adaptation. Philosophy calls it care. Psychology calls it development. Indigenous wisdom calls it reciprocity. They all found the same patterns."

## IDEAL CLIENT

| Characteristic | Indicator |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Developmental stage** | Operating at Stage 4, sensing its limits |
| **Orientation** | Values relationship over transaction |
| **Goal** | Seeking transformation, not just automation |
| **Reciprocity** | Comfortable giving insights, not just receiving |
| **Fit preference** | Wants AI that fits them, not vice versa |

**One-line:** "People whose thinking deserves better than generic AI, who sense their current framework has limits, who are ready for actual transformation."
