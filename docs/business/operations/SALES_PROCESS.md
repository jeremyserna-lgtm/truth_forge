# SALES PROCESS
## Care Ethics in Client Acquisition

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Purpose:** Define sales process aligned with philosophical foundations

---

## SALES PHILOSOPHY

### What We Believe

**Traditional sales:** Create urgency → Overcome objections → Close the deal
**Convergent sales:** Build relationship → Assess fit → Make mutual decision

We don't "close" clients. We enter into relationship with people who are right for this work.

### The Care Ethics Foundation

- No manipulation
- No artificial urgency
- No pressure tactics
- No overselling
- No hiding uncertainty

**The paradox:** This approach converts BETTER than traditional sales because:
1. Right-fit clients feel the difference and trust it
2. Wrong-fit clients self-select out early (saving everyone time)
3. Clients who engage are genuinely committed
4. Referrals come naturally from authentic relationships

## THE SALES FUNNEL

### Overview

```
AWARENESS → RESONANCE → DISCOVERY → PROPOSAL → DECISION → ONBOARDING

 They find    "This feels   "Do we      "Here's    Mutual      Relationship
   you        different"     fit?"      what I      yes/no      begins
                                      recommend"
```

### Stage Definitions

| Stage | Goal | Your Role | Their Experience |
|-------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **Awareness** | They learn you exist | Create signal | "Interesting..." |
| **Resonance** | They feel drawn | Be authentic | "This feels different" |
| **Discovery** | Assess mutual fit | Listen deeply | "They're really seeing me" |
| **Proposal** | Recommend path | Be honest | "Clear, confident, no pressure" |
| **Decision** | Mutual commitment | Hold space | "I'm choosing this" |
| **Onboarding** | Begin relationship | Welcome with care | "I made the right choice" |

---

## STAGE 1: AWARENESS

### How They Find You

| Channel | Approach | Alignment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Referrals** | Satisfied clients mention you | Care ethics (relationships create referrals) |
| **Content** | Articles, posts that demonstrate thinking | Stage 5 (seeing what others miss) |
| **Speaking** | Talks, podcasts, workshops | Convergent architecture (share the framework) |
| **Network** | Professional connections, communities | Indigenous reciprocity (give value freely) |

### Content Strategy for Awareness

**Content types that attract right-fit clients:**

1. **Pattern reveals** - "Here's what I notice about how [type of person] thinks that they often can't see themselves"
2. **Framework applications** - "How convergent architecture applies to [specific domain]"
3. **Honest assessments** - "Why most AI solutions fail, and what actually works"
4. **Transformation stories** - Case studies of actual change (with permission)

**Tone:** Confident but humble. Clear but not salesy. Insightful but accessible.

### Metrics

- Not "leads generated"
- **Resonance indicators:** People who engage deeply, share thoughtfully, reach out with genuine questions

---

## STAGE 2: RESONANCE

### What Resonance Looks Like

Someone moves from Awareness to Resonance when they:
- Consume multiple pieces of content
- Share your work with others
- Engage in comments/responses with substance
- Reach out with a genuine question (not just "what's your pricing")
- Express something like "this feels different" or "you're describing something I've been looking for"

### Nurturing Resonance

**Do:**
- Respond thoughtfully to genuine engagement
- Offer additional resources that match their apparent interest
- Be generous with insight (give value freely)
- Let them set the pace

**Don't:**
- Push to "get on a call"
- Add them to automated sequences
- Treat engagement as "lead qualification"
- Rush the relationship

### The Resonance Question

When someone reaches out, ask yourself:

> "Is this person genuinely curious, or are they just shopping?"

Genuine curiosity deserves engagement. Shopping deserves a clear answer and space.

---

## STAGE 3: DISCOVERY

### Purpose

Discovery is mutual fit assessment. You're both figuring out if this is right.

**Your questions:**
- Is this person operating at Stage 4, sensing its limits? (Right developmental moment)
- Do they value relationship over transaction? (Right orientation)
- Are they seeking transformation or just automation? (Right goal)
- Can I actually help them? (Honest assessment)

**Their questions:**
- Can this person see what I can't see myself?
- Do I trust them?
- Is this the right investment?
- Will this actually help?

### Discovery Call Structure (30-45 minutes)

**1. Opening (5 min)**

> "Thanks for taking the time. I'd love to understand what drew you here and what you're hoping to figure out. Then I can share what I do and we can both assess if there's a fit. Sound good?"

Set the frame: mutual exploration, not pitch.

**2. Their Story (15-20 min)**

Ask open questions. Listen for patterns.

- "What's going on in your work/life that brought you here?"
- "What have you tried that hasn't worked?"
- "What would be different if this worked?"
- "What does success look like for you?"

**Listen for:**
- Stage 4 indicators (have a system, sense its limits)
- Transformation orientation (want change, not just tools)
- Relational capacity (comfortable with back-and-forth)
- Red flags (wants magic bullet, purely transactional, not ready)

**3. Reflection (5 min)**

Offer what you see. This is a mini-demonstration of The Seeing.

> "Here's what I'm noticing as you talk... [pattern you observe]. Does that resonate?"

This does two things:
1. Demonstrates your capacity
2. Creates value before any commitment

**4. Fit Assessment (5-10 min)**

Be honest about what you see.

**If it's a fit:**
> "I think I can help. Here's what I'd recommend: [specific next step, usually The Seeing]. The investment is [price]. This feels like a [High/Medium/Low] confidence situation to me because [honest reasoning]. Want me to explain more about what The Seeing involves?"

**If it's not a fit:**
> "I appreciate you sharing all this. Honestly, I'm not sure I'm the right resource for where you are right now. Here's why: [honest reasoning]. What might serve you better is [alternative recommendation]. If things shift and [condition], feel free to reach back out."

**If you're uncertain:**
> "I'm genuinely not sure if I'm the right fit. I could see it going either way. What would help me know is [specific information]. Can you tell me more about that?"

**5. Close (5 min)**

If there's interest, define next step clearly.

> "Here's what I'd suggest: I'll send you a summary of our conversation plus a proposal for The Seeing. Take a few days to sit with it. If you have questions, email me. If it feels right, we'll schedule. No pressure, no follow-up harassment. Sound good?"

### Discovery Call Scripts

**Opening question alternatives:**
- "What's the problem you're trying to solve?"
- "What would you want to be different in 6 months?"
- "What's been on your mind that brought you here?"

**Deepening questions:**
- "Say more about that."
- "What makes that particularly hard?"
- "When has it worked? What was different?"
- "What have you tried?"
- "What would change if this were solved?"

**Pattern reflection openers:**
- "Here's what I'm noticing..."
- "The pattern I'm seeing is..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "Correct me if I'm wrong, but..."

**Fit assessment phrases:**

| Situation | Language |
|-----------|----------|
| Clear fit | "I'm confident I can help with this." |
| Likely fit | "I think there's something here. The Seeing would clarify it." |
| Uncertain | "I'm not sure yet. Can you tell me more about X?" |
| Not a fit | "Honestly, I don't think I'm the right resource for this." |
| Not ready | "This feels like something you might need to work through first before AI infrastructure would help." |

### Discovery Don'ts

- Don't pitch. Explore.
- Don't oversell. Be honest about uncertainty.
- Don't pressure. Hold space.
- Don't pretend fit when there isn't. It wastes everyone's time.
- Don't dismiss too quickly. Sometimes fit emerges.

---

## STAGE 4: PROPOSAL

### Philosophy

The proposal isn't a sales document. It's a recommendation.

**Framing:**
> "Based on what we discussed, here's what I'd recommend and why. You should have everything you need to make a decision."

### Proposal Structure

**1. Summary of What We Discussed**
Reflect back their situation. Show you listened.

**2. What I Observe**
The patterns you noticed. Early glimpse of The Seeing.

**3. My Recommendation**

**4. Confidence Assessment**
Honest statement of what you're confident about and what's uncertain.

**5. What Success Looks Like**
Paint the picture of transformation.

**6. Investment and Terms**
Clear pricing, payment terms, what's included.

**7. Next Steps**
How to proceed if they decide yes.

**8. Questions Welcome**
Invitation to discuss, no pressure.

[Signature]
```

### Proposal Timing

- Send within 24-48 hours of Discovery call
- Follow up once at 7 days if no response (gentle, not pushy)
- After 14 days, send a "closing the loop" message
- After 30 days, proposal expires (they can restart conversation anytime)

---

## STAGE 5: DECISION

### Philosophy

The decision is theirs. Your job is to hold space, not create pressure.

### What Holding Space Looks Like

**Do:**
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Clarify anything unclear
- Acknowledge the weight of the decision
- Respect their timeline
- Trust their process

**Don't:**
- Follow up repeatedly
- Create artificial urgency ("price goes up Friday!")
- Imply they're making a mistake by waiting
- Take delayed decisions personally

### Handling "I Need to Think About It"

> "Of course. This is a significant decision and should feel right. Take the time you need. If questions come up, email me. I'll check in once in about a week unless you'd prefer I don't."

### Handling "Yes"

> "Great. I'm looking forward to working together. Here's what happens next: [clear next steps]. I'll send [invoice/scheduling link/etc.] within 24 hours. Welcome."

### Handling "No"

> "I appreciate you letting me know. If circumstances change or if I can help in another way down the road, I'm here. Thanks for the thoughtful consideration."

**Never:**
- Ask "why not" in a pressuring way
- Try to "overcome the objection"
- Make them feel bad

**You can ask (gently):**
> "Would you be willing to share what didn't feel right? It helps me improve. No obligation."

### Handling "Not Right Now"

> "That makes sense. When would be a good time to check back in? [Or] Feel free to reach out when timing is better. I'll be here."

---

## STAGE 6: ONBOARDING

## SALES METRICS

### What We Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Resonance-to-Discovery rate** | Are we attracting the right people? |
| **Discovery-to-Proposal rate** | Are Discovery calls identifying fit accurately? |
| **Proposal-to-Decision rate** | Are proposals compelling and clear? |
| **Decision-to-Yes rate** | Are we serving people who are ready? |
| **Time in each stage** | Is the process flowing or stuck? |
| **Referral rate** | Are clients becoming advocates? |

### What We Don't Track

- "Leads generated" (vanity metric)
- "Calls booked" (activity without quality)
- "Close rate" at all costs (wrong frame)

### Healthy Benchmarks

| Metric | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Discovery-to-Proposal | 60-80% (most Discovery calls should be qualified) |
| Proposal-to-Yes | 40-60% (if higher, might be pricing too low; if lower, might be poor fit assessment) |
| Time to Decision | 1-3 weeks (longer isn't bad if they need it) |
| Referral rate | 30%+ of clients refer at least one person |

## OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "I need to think about it."

> "Of course. What questions are still open that would help you decide?"

*Listen. Answer. Hold space.*

### "It's more than I expected."

> "I understand. Let me be clear about what you're paying for: [specific value]. If the investment doesn't feel right, I'd rather find the right scope than force a fit. What would feel right?"

### "Can you discount it?"

> "I don't discount, but I can scope differently. What budget are you working with? Let me see what we could accomplish within that."

### "I want to compare other options."

> "That makes sense. You should feel confident in your choice. What would be most helpful for you to compare?"

### "I'm not sure I'm ready."

> "That's important to honor. What would need to be true for you to be ready? Sometimes The Seeing itself clarifies readiness."

### "What if it doesn't work?"

> "Fair question. Here's how I think about it: [confidence assessment]. Where I'm uncertain, here's how we'd handle it: [specific approach]. The relationship doesn't end at delivery—Stewardship exists to ensure it keeps working."

### "I've been burned before."

> "I hear that. What happened? [Listen.] Here's what I do differently: [specific contrast]. And I'm honest about what I'm uncertain about—I won't overpromise."

## SALES INTEGRITY CHECKLIST

Before every sales interaction, verify:

- [ ] Am I being honest about what I can deliver?
- [ ] Am I assessing fit genuinely, not just looking to close?
- [ ] Am I honoring their timeline and process?
- [ ] Am I being transparent about uncertainty?
- [ ] Would I be proud of this interaction if it were public?

*Sales is relationship initiation.*

*The process should feel like the partnership it's beginning.*
