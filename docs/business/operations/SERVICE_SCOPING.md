- What systems need to connect?
- What data needs to flow?
- What are the technical constraints?

**Step 3: Complexity Estimation**
- How many components?
- How much customization?
- How much is proven vs. novel?

**Step 4: Confidence Assessment**
- What am I highly confident about?
- What has uncertainty?
- What's new territory?

**Step 5: Scope Definition**
- Exactly what's included
- Exactly what's excluded
- Success criteria
- Timeline

**Transformation Package:**
- The Seeing
- Standard Build (scoped during Seeing)
- 6 months Standard Stewardship

**Partnership Package:**
