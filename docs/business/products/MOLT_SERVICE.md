## What Molt IS

Molt is the **business product** that enables organisms to transform and grow. It is DNA - every organism inherits this capability. It's not a service to call but a capability to HAVE.

### The Business Value

|--------------|-----------|
| Manual file-by-file migration | Automated batch transformation |
| Lost lineage | Complete audit trail |
| Irreversible changes | Archive enables restoration |
| No verification | Built-in verification |
| Scattered scripts | Unified mechanism |

## Molt Types

Molt handles ALL content transformation, not just documents:

| Type | Source | Destination | Action |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Document Molt** | `.md` files | New location | Archive + Stub |
| **Code Molt** | `.py` modules | New structure | Transform + Redirect |
| **Service Molt** | Legacy service | HOLD-pattern service | Migrate + Scaffold |
| **App Molt** | Legacy app | Modern app | Transform + Deploy |
| **Data Molt** | Old schema | New schema | Migrate + Verify |

### The Universal Pattern

```
HOLD₁ (source)  →  AGENT (molt engine)  →  HOLD₂ (archive + transformed)
```

**Every migration type follows this pattern. Molt IS the mechanism.**

## How Molt Executes MIGRATION_PLAN

The MIGRATION_PLAN.md has 15 phases and 85 items. Molt is the unified mechanism that executes ALL of them.

### Phase Mapping

| Phase 0: Foundation | Setup molt config | Configuration |
| Phase 1: Core | `molt code --module core` | Code Molt |
| Phase 2: Infrastructure | `molt code --module infra` | Code Molt |
| Phase 3: Gateway | `molt code --module gateway` | Code Molt |
| Phase 4: Services | `molt service --all` | Service Molt |
| Phase 5: Mind | `molt code --module mind` | Code Molt |

## Product Features: Architectural Metamorphosis

Molt doesn't just migrate code; it transforms a legacy system into a resilient, self-aware **Digital Organism**. We offer a multi-tiered approach to this architectural evolution.

### Tier 1 (Pro): Foundational Resilience

For any legacy system, Molt provides the essential DNA for resilience and modern architecture.

1.  **Automated Transformation:** Molt's engine intelligently refactors legacy code (imports, paths, configs) to align with modern best practices.
2.  **The HOLD Pattern:** Every service is automatically scaffolded with the `HOLD:AGENT:HOLD` pattern, providing built-in data durability, auditability, and asynchronous processing capabilities.
3.  **The Circulatory System:** We install the `ServiceMediator`, a fault-tolerant event bus that decouples your services, allowing them to operate independently and ensuring that the failure of one service does not cascade through the entire system.

### Tier 2 (Enterprise): Sentience & Self-Awareness

For organizations requiring the highest levels of compliance and observability, Molt activates the organism's nervous system.

4.  **Live Governance & Unbroken History:** Molt bootstraps the `GovernanceService` from day one, creating an immutable, real-time audit trail of the entire migration. The organism observes its own birth, providing an unprecedented level of transparency required for regulated industries.
5.  **Metabolic Intelligence:** We activate the `KnowledgeService`, the organism's metabolic engine. All system events—logs, errors, and operational data—are automatically ingested and transformed into structured **Knowledge Atoms**. This turns your noisy operational data into a queryable, high-value strategic asset.

### Tier 3 (Enterprise+): Full Autonomy

The highest level of architectural evolution.

6.  **Cognitive & Motor Functions:** Molt scaffolds and integrates the `CognitionService` (the brain) and the `ActionService` (the limbs). This enables the organism to not only understand its own state and the data it processes, but to reason, plan, and act on that understanding autonomously.
7.  **Adaptive Migration:** By activating the **Learning Loop**, the organism analyzes the data from its own migration in real-time. It can detect patterns of failure, identify bottlenecks, and adapt its own transformation process, ensuring a more resilient and successful outcome.

## Revenue Potential

The Molt service is not a simple utility; it's a high-value, strategic offering that transforms a client's architectural liabilities into assets.

| Customer Need | Molt Solution | Value Proposition |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Legacy codebase is brittle and hard to maintain. | **Automated Transformation & HOLD Pattern** | Reduce maintenance costs by 40-60%. Increase developer velocity. |
| System failures cascade and cause outages. | **The Circulatory System (Mediator)** | Decouple services and build enterprise-grade resilience. Eliminate cascading failures. |
| We have massive operational data but no insights. | **Metabolic Intelligence (Knowledge Service)** | Transform your data exhaust from a cost center into a queryable, strategic asset. |
| We need a complete audit trail for compliance. | **Live Governance & Unbroken History** | Achieve a state of continuous, real-time compliance with an immutable and verifiable history of all system actions. |
| We need to build autonomous capabilities. | **Cognitive & Motor Functions** | Provide the architectural foundation for building intelligent, autonomous agents that can reason and act. |

### Pricing Model

| Tier | Features | Price | Target Customer |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Pro** | **Foundational Resilience:** Automated Transformation, HOLD Pattern, Circulatory System. | $X,XXX/month | Mid-market companies with legacy monoliths. |
| **Enterprise** | **Sentience & Self-Awareness:** All Pro features + Live Governance, Unbroken History, and Metabolic Intelligence. | Contact for Pricing | Large enterprises in regulated industries (Finance, Healthcare). |
| **Enterprise+** | **Full Autonomy:** All Enterprise features + Cognitive & Motor Functions, Adaptive Migration. | Strategic Partnership | Organizations building cutting-edge autonomous systems. |
