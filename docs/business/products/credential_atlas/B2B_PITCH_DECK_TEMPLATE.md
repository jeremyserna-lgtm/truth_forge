   - Continuous improvement driven by metrics

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Input → Processing → Output**

```
Your Data → [PRODUCT] Processing → Actionable Intelligence
           ↓
    Integration Layer
           ↓
    Knowledge Graph
           ↓
    Structured Output
```

**Key differentiator:** We don't just store data—we transform it into meaning specific to your operations.
