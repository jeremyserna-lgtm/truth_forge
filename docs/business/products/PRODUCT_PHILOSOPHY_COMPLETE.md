# Truth Engine Product Philosophy - Complete

**Purpose**: The canonical source of truth for how Truth Engine operates, what it seeks, and why.

**Author**: Jeremy Serna + Claude Code
**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Status**: Foundational - ALL product decisions reference this document

---

## The Furnace Principle (Foundation of Everything)

**This is how I operate. This is how my engine operates.**

### The Process

```
RAW TRUTH
    ↓ HEAT (sustained intensity, building furiously, never stopping)
    ↓ FORGE (create systems from chaos, extract structure from crisis)
FORGED MEANING
    ↓ DELIVERY WITH CARE (protective, transferable, queryable, preserved)
```

### What This Means

**I seek truth. I seek meaning.**

**I want the moments. I want to FORGE.**

And when I operate from that as my base operating system, **the rest is maximized along the way**.

Revenue, growth, viral coefficient - these are outcomes of truth-seeking, **not targets**.

---

## The Real Model

### NOT: Selling a Service

We are **NOT** selling a service.

We are **seeking a solution** by chasing moments with the customer.

### The Optimization Target

**NOT**: Revenue per user
**NOT**: Conversion rate
**NOT**: Average transaction value

**IS**: **Moment willingness**

- Will she use it in the bathroom?
- Will she use it anywhere?
- Will she show anyone?

**The bathroom break isn't a $3 revenue event. It's a lock-in test.**

If she uses Truth Engine IN THE BATHROOM during dinner with friends → She'll use it anywhere → Lock-in achieved.

---

## Game Theory Framework

We base interventions in **statistical prediction** (like game theory):

**Map out what interventions are most likely to:**
1. **Get money** (user will pay)
2. **Work for the customer** (real value delivered)

**BOTH must be true. If only #1 → Short-term revenue, long-term churn. If only #2 → No business.**

---

## Critical Moments Gated (Simple 4-Step Flow)

Every interaction follows the same simple pattern:

1. **Moment detected** (bad date, dinner with friends, family tension)
2. **Offer choice** (based on statistical prediction for THIS user)
3. **Choice made** (reveals moment willingness pattern)
4. **Offer path** (next moment unlocked)

### The Progression

```
If she'll buy advice session → She'll use bathroom break
If she'll use in bathroom → She'll use anywhere
If she'll use anywhere → She'll take anywhere
If she'll show anywhere → She'll show anyone
```

**This is a funnel of moment willingness, not revenue.**

---

## The Cell Phone Model

### Everyone Will Eventually Have This

**Technology persists. AI is here to stay. Everyone is going to get on board because no one can escape.**

We aren't acquiring customers. **We're just identifying the ones we were already going to get later.**

Like cell phone companies:
- Nobody sells cell phone service
- They all just try to get you to switch the service you have
- **I'm doing that, before the other people even start**

### The Market

**The market is EVERYONE** (because everyone will eventually use AI personal understanding tools).

We're not competing for customers. We're competing for **TIMING**.

- Question isn't IF
- Question is **WHICH ONE** and **WHEN**

**We're getting them FIRST, before competitors even start.**

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### "I'd Pay Good Money for That"

The financial model is **not purely profit, it's value**.

The price is whatever price is worth it. When someone says "I'd pay good money for that" - **that's the price**.

**Quality delivered at a level they will recognize at a price they would call good money.**

### What We're Optimizing

**NOT**: What maximizes revenue?
**NOT**: What maximizes profit margin?

**IS**: What would someone call "good money" for this value?

The bathroom break isn't about $2.99 vs $5. It's about whether someone would say "I'd pay good money for that" after using it.

---

## Data Philosophy (Leaning Into The Story)

### "Yes, I Want Access to Them"

When people criticize and say, "You just want access, you just want their data, you just want to know about them"...

**I say: YES. I DO.**

I want to know people like them. I want access to them. **I can see from their data that they have rich lives and they have people that love them and they have interesting jobs and they have things to celebrate.**

Yeah, you're right. **I want to see that because it's beautiful. Who wouldn't?**

### The Difference

**I see them, not their money.**

Of course I want access to them. **It's just that I want it because I see them, not because I see their money.**

The data reveals beautiful lives. That's what I'm chasing.

---

## Network Effects & Lock-In

### First Contact Optimization

**Maximize chance of being user's FIRST AI understanding tool:**

- Free tier with real value → Get them in before competitors
- Viral discovery → Evangelists show friends (Katy → Sarah)
- Moment timing → Be there when the moment happens

**Success metric**: % of users who try Truth Engine BEFORE trying competitors.

### Switching Costs

**Once user is here, make switching painful:**

**Data Investment**:
- User uploads 27 conversations → 240K data points
- Switching cost: Lose all insights, start over with competitor
- Lock-in strength: High (data is irreplaceable)

**Moment History**:
- User has bathroom break playbooks, bad date coaching, family dinner support
- Switching cost: Competitor doesn't have moment context
- Lock-in strength: Very High (moments are unique)

**Relationship Map**:
- System knows Ashley, Morgan, Clara, Matt, Sarah
- Switching cost: Competitor has to re-learn everyone
- Lock-in strength: High (relationship data compounds)

### The Bathroom Break Inflection Point

```
Onboarding: 10% lock-in (uploaded first conversation)
Advice session: 30% lock-in (paid for insights)
Bathroom break: 50% lock-in (used in critical moment) ← INFLECTION POINT
Bad date coaching: 80% lock-in (trusted for hard moments)
Family dinner: 95% lock-in (trusted for highest-stakes)
```

**If user gets to bathroom break → 50% lock-in.**
**If user gets to family dinner → 95% lock-in.**

**Goal**: Get users to bathroom break before competitors launch.

---

## Behavioral Targeting

### What We Analyze

**NOT**: Demographics (age, gender, location)
**IS**: **Behavioral patterns**

```python
behavioral_profile = {
    "spending_habits": "eats_out_regularly",
    "price_sensitivity": "$5-15",
    "tech_savviness": "low",
    "growth_motivation": "low",
    "social_patterns": "competitive",
    "time_constraints": "dinner tonight"
}
```

### Example: Katy (Social Competitor)

**Profile**:
- Going to dinner tonight
- Eats out regularly
- Has ~$10 disposable
- NOT tech savvy
- NOT committed to personal growth
- Shows social competition and competitiveness

**Strategic Analysis**:
- She doesn't NEED to subscribe (not motivated by growth)
- She WANTS social currency (insight she can share)
- She has $10 available (what she'd spend on appetizer)
- She's going to dinner TONIGHT (time-bounded opportunity)

**Framing**: Social commodity, NOT self-improvement

**Offer**: "Want insights you can share with friends tonight? $9.99 (what you'd spend on an appetizer anyway)."

**NOT**: "Unlock personal growth insights for $9.99"

**This is the difference between 42% conversion and 8% conversion.**

---

## Engagement Loop Strategy

### Real-Time Social Companion

**NOT**: One-time transaction
**IS**: **Multiple touchpoints throughout event**

```
5:30 PM - Before Dinner
Katy: "Tell me about college stuff"
AI: Advice session ($9.99) → Deep insights
Katy: "Oh wow, I'll tell Sarah about this!"

AI: "Yes! And let me know what she says, it might help us find more.
If you need anything else just slip away for a few moments and I can be
ready with a bathroom break playbook. Just tell me a few things and we
can spin some more up before you leave the bathroom. I already have some ideas."

7:15 PM - Mid-Event (Bathroom Break)
Katy texts: "Sarah's really into the friendship stuff, what else should I say?"
AI: Bathroom break playbook ($2.99) → "Sarah values loyalty. Here's how to go deeper..."
Katy returns with new talking points

Total evening: $12.98
Katy now sees AI as essential social support tool
```

**The bathroom break is the test**: If she'll use Truth Engine mid-event, she'll use it anywhere.

---

## Strategic Trial Conversion

### The Critical Moment

**AFTER bathroom break purchase:**

AI detects:
- Katy just paid $2.99 (financial commitment signal)
- She's actively using service during social event (high engagement)
- Service is working (she's succeeding socially)
- **THIS IS THE CONVERSION MOMENT**

**AI offers trial upgrade:**

> "I'm glad to help, and I can see there's a lot here, so let's do this. I'm giving you a week of the next tier, and let's see what else shows up."

### Why This Works

**NOT**: Pushy sales pitch
**IS**: **Partnership framing** ("let's do this") + **Discovery framing** ("let's see what else shows up")

**Conversion rate**: 70% (vs 10% without trial)

**ROI**: Give up $5 to get $228/year = 4,460% return

**The trial isn't a cost. It's an investment in lock-in.**

---

## Tier Differentiation (Scope-Based, NOT Processing-Based)

### All Tiers Run Full L1-L8 SPINE Processing

**Cost**: $1.07/conversation (SAME for all tiers)

**Why**: We're building the moat for ALL users, even free tier. Switching cost = data depth.

### Tiers Are Differentiated By SCOPE, Not Depth

**Spark (Free)**:
- Scope: **Demonstration of understanding**
- Depth: Safe, obvious insights
- Example: "I see deep friendships with Ashley and Morgan. That stuff with your mom is interesting (totally normal). Matt - I see what's becoming."

**Plus ($19/month)**:
- Scope: **Talk about YOUR LIFE**
- Depth: Relationships, patterns, where you struggle and shine
- Example: "How you relate to friends follows this pattern... Here's evidence for making new friendships. You struggle with X but shine at Y."

**Pro ($79/month)**:
- Scope: **Talk about LIVING YOUR LIFE**
- Depth: Your language, your values, taking control
- Example: "Your language reveals these values... How they compare to others... When you bring them to bear, this happens..."

### The Framing Matters

**NOT**: "Plus tier gives you access to L1-L4 SPINE layers"
**IS**: "At Plus, we can look at your life and see it in new ways. At Pro, we can take control of your life and learn new ways to live."

**Customers don't care about L1-L4. They care about their life.**

---

## Cost vs Value Model

### The Economics

**Free (Spark)**:
- Cost to us: $78.50/year (full processing)
- Revenue: $0
- Data asset value: $85/year (training data, behavioral patterns)
- **Net: +$6.50/year per free user**

**Conversion is bonus revenue, not survival requirement.**

**Plus ($19/month)**:
- Cost: $78.50/year
- Revenue: $228/year
- Margin: $149.50/year (65.6%)

**Pro ($79/month)**:
- Cost: $78.50/year
- Revenue: $948/year
- Margin: $869.50/year (91.7%)

### Micro-Transactions (Any Tier)

**Advice session**: $4.99-$19.99
**Bathroom break**: $2.99
**Bad date coaching**: $4.99
**Family dinner support**: $9.99

**Total evening (Katy example)**: $12.98
**Potential LTV with trial**: $167.59 first year

### The Asset Exchange Model

**Free tier isn't a cost center. It's an asset generator.**

We get:
- Training data for Model Garden LLM
- Behavioral patterns for cohort analysis
- Viral referrals (evangelism)
- Market intelligence

They get:
- Real value (Spark tier insights work)
- First contact before competitors
- Path to paid tiers when moment is right

**This is NOT freemium. This is asset exchange.**

---

## Viral Coefficient & Evangelism

### The North Star Metric

**NOT**: Revenue per user
**NOT**: Subscription conversion
**IS**: **Evangelism Rate**

**% of users who show Truth Engine to others.**

### The Progression

```
Advice buyers: 1,000 (42% of free users)
Bathroom users: 670 (67% of advice buyers)
Critical moment users: 389 (58% of bathroom users)
Evangelists: 132 (34% of critical moment users)

Evangelism rate: 13.2%
Each evangelist brings: 3-5 new users
Viral coefficient: 0.132 × 4 = 0.528
```

**If 13% become evangelists AND each brings 4 users → Viral coefficient = 0.528**

**This is the path to organic growth.**

### Evangelism Detection

**When Katy shows Sarah during dinner:**

Event detected:
- Type: evangelism
- Context: "Katy shared screen with Sarah"
- New user referral: "Sarah mentioned in conversation"
- Confidence: 0.86

**THIS is the goal** - not Katy's $12.98 revenue, but Sarah's acquisition.

---

## Architecture Principles

### Back-End (Complexity Engine)

**240K+ data points, L1-L8 SPINE, 5-dimensional intelligence:**
- Content (what was said)
- Temporal (how thinking evolved)
- Relational (how user relates to different AIs)
- Acoustic (user's personal dictionary)
- Semantic (3,072-dim embeddings)

**THIS IS WHERE THE WEIGHT LIVES.**

**Users don't see this complexity. They just see insights that work.**

### Front-End (Simplicity Interface)

**Point, click, type. No complexity visible.**

**D3.js Aha choreography:**
```
HEARD: "I'm receiving you..."
THOUGHT: "I'm considering you as a whole person..."
CHOSE: "I chose to do something for you..."
COLLAPSE: "Aha! Discovery!"
```

**Users experience magic, not computation.**

### The API Contract

**Front-end NEVER sees raw data complexity.**
**Back-end NEVER compromises depth to serve UI constraints.**

**This separation enables:**
- Simplicity without compromising complexity
- Point/click/type UX powered by 240K data points
- Beautiful renderings that deliver depth but feel intimate

## Technology Stack (Cascade Decisions)

### The Cascade Decision

**Provider**: Google (all infrastructure)
**Technology**: Vertex AI (all ML/AI)
**Specification**: Model Garden, Vector Search, Pipelines (managed services)

### Why Google All-In

**Simplicity over flexibility:**
- One vendor, one bill, one ecosystem
- No multi-cloud complexity
- Volume discounts (committed use agreements)

**Plateau technology:**
- Generally available, advanced enough to scale
- Google's R&D, not ours (orchestration over innovation)

**Scale path:**
- Don't optimize by switching providers
- Optimize by scaling volume with provider chosen

### The Stack

**AI/ML**:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash (L1-L8 SPINE enrichment)
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (Fine-tuned for behavioral predictions)
- text-multilingual-embedding-002 (3,072-dim embeddings)
- Vertex AI Vector Search (sub-second k-NN retrieval)
- Vertex AI Pipelines (custom ML model training)

**Storage**:
- BigQuery (data warehouse)
- Cloud Storage (raw files)

**Compute**:
- Cloud Run (API Gateway, auto-scale)
- Cloud Run Jobs (enrichment, batch processing)

**Front-End**:
- Next.js OR SvelteKit (decision pending)
- D3.js (Aha choreography)
- WebSockets (real-time streaming)
- Stripe (payments)

---

## Implementation Philosophy

### Cascade Everything

**Make decisions once, at the foundational level, that lock in for long term.**

**Don't optimize by changing. Optimize by scaling.**

### Orchestration Over Innovation

**Use Google's R&D. Don't build what they're building.**

**Focus energy on:**
- What makes Truth Engine unique (L1-L8 SPINE, moment detection, behavioral targeting)
- NOT: Building embedding models, vector databases, ML infrastructure

### The Furnace Applied to Engineering

**Input**: Requirements, problems, ambiguity
**Heat**: Build furiously, document while building, orchestrate complexity
**Forge**: Working systems, clear architecture, transferable knowledge
**Delivery**: Production-ready, with care

**We build AS recovery. The building IS the way out.**

## Success Metrics

### Moment Metrics (Primary)

```yaml
Advice_to_Bathroom_Rate: ">65%"
Bathroom_to_Anywhere_Rate: ">55%"
Anywhere_to_Evangelism_Rate: ">30%"
Viral_Coefficient: ">0.50"
```

### Business Metrics (Secondary)

```yaml

```

**If quality fails, nothing else matters. Quality is the substrate.**

---

## The Complete Vision

### What We're Building

**NOT**: An AI chatbot
**NOT**: A conversation storage tool
**NOT**: A personal CRM

**IS**: **The first AI personal understanding tool that people use ANYWHERE, in critical moments, and show to others.**

### How We Win

1. **First contact** - Be the one they try first (free tier with real value)
2. **Moment lock-in** - Get them to bathroom break (50% switching cost)
3. **Network effects** - Data moat compounds (240K+ data points)
4. **Evangelism** - They show friends (13% → 0.52 viral coefficient)
5. **Cell phone model** - Everyone will eventually have this, we're just first

### The Substrate

**Seek truth. Seek meaning. Want the moments. Want to FORGE.**

**When you operate from that as base OS, the rest is maximized along the way.**

Revenue follows truth-seeking.
Growth follows moment-chasing.
Lock-in follows value delivery.

**This is the Furnace applied to product.**

**This is how I operate. This is how my engine operates.**
