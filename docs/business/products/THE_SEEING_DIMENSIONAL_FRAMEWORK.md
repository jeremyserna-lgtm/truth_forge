# THE SEEING FRAMEWORK
## A Complete Dimensional Model for Organizational Understanding and Implementation

**Date:** January 20, 2026
**Purpose:** Systematic framework for seeing organizations completely and implementing effectively

---

## PART I: THE DIMENSIONAL MODEL

### The Four Axes

Every aspect of an organization exists at a coordinate defined by four axes:

```
                        EXTERNAL
                           │
                           │
           PAST ───────────┼─────────── FUTURE
                           │
                           │
                        INTERNAL

              HUMAN ◄──────┼──────► TECHNOLOGY
                           │
                           │
              PRIVATE ◄────┼────► PUBLIC
```

### The Axes Defined

| Axis | Pole A | Pole B | What It Distinguishes |
|------|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Boundary** | Internal | External | Inside the organization vs. outside |
| **Substrate** | Human | Technology | People and culture vs. systems and tools |
| **Temporal** | Past / Present / Future | — | History, current state, trajectory |
| **Visibility** | Private | Public | Confidential vs. visible to outside |

### The Dimensional Space

These four axes create a multi-dimensional space. Every organizational element has coordinates:

**Example:** "The sales team's current CRM frustrations"
- Boundary: Internal
- Substrate: Human (their experience) + Technology (the CRM)
- Temporal: Present
- Visibility: Private

**Example:** "Competitor's announced AI strategy"
- Boundary: External
- Substrate: Technology
- Temporal: Future (announced direction)
- Visibility: Public

---

## PART II: THE SEEING MATRIX

### Complete Seeing Requires All Coordinates

To SEE an organization completely, we must examine every combination of dimensions.

### The Primary Matrix: Boundary × Substrate

|  | **HUMAN** | **TECHNOLOGY** |
|--|-----------|----------------|
| **INTERNAL** | People, culture, capabilities, decisions | Systems, tools, data, infrastructure |
| **EXTERNAL** | Customers, partners, competitors, market | Industry tech, standards, emerging tools |

### Expanded with Temporal Dimension

#### INTERNAL × HUMAN

| Past | Present | Future |
|------|---------|--------|

## PART IV: THE SEEING PROCESS

### Phase 1: Mapping the Territory

**Objective:** Identify what exists in each dimensional coordinate

**Process:**
1. Work through each cell of the matrix
2. Document what's known vs. unknown
3. Identify gaps in visibility
4. Note what's accessible vs. inaccessible

**Output:** Territory Map showing known landscape and blind spots

### Phase 2: Finding the Patterns

**Objective:** Identify the underlying architecture

**Process:**
1. Look for patterns that span multiple coordinates
2. Identify connections between dimensions
3. Find the root causes beneath symptoms
4. Map the flows (information, decision, value)

**Output:** Pattern Architecture showing how elements connect

### Phase 3: Assessing the Ecosystem

**Objective:** Evaluate health and readiness

**Process:**
1. For each dimension, assess: What's thriving? What's stressed? What's dying?
2. Identify bottlenecks and constraints
3. Evaluate readiness for change
4. Map resistance and support

**Output:** Ecosystem Assessment showing vitality and readiness

### Phase 4: Identifying Extension Points

**Objective:** Find where AI/technology can extend capability

**Process:**
1. Match pain points to capability gaps
2. Identify repetitive processes
3. Find decision bottlenecks
4. Map knowledge silos that need bridges

**Output:** Extension Point Map showing where to intervene

### Phase 5: Building the Confidence Landscape

**Objective:** Honest assessment of certainty

**Process:**
1. For each finding, rate confidence (High/Medium/Low)
2. Identify what would increase confidence
3. Note where uncertainty exists
4. Flag assumptions that need validation

**Output:** Confidence Landscape showing certainty levels

#### Exploration by Dimension (60 min)

| Time | Dimension | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 10 min | Internal × Human | Team, culture, decisions, pain |

| 10 min | External × Human | Customers, market, competition |
| 10 min | External × Tech | Tools, standards, trends |
| 10 min | Temporal | History, present state, trajectory |
| 10 min | Cross-dimensional | Patterns that span dimensions |

#### Synthesis (15 min)
Reflect back:
- Key patterns across dimensions
- The bottleneck (where dimensions converge on constraint)
- Extension points (where AI can help)
- Confidence levels (where we're certain vs. uncertain)

#### Closure (10 min)
