## Translation Examples

### Elevator Pitch

**Internal version:**
> "Truth Engine devours your institutional knowledge, metabolizes it through the furnace, and creates immortality—your organization becomes a star that never dies."

**External version:**
> "Truth Engine integrates your institutional knowledge, processes it through our intelligence platform, and creates persistent organizational memory—ensuring your expertise scales beyond any individual."

### Technical Overview

**Internal version:**
> "The system implements HOLD → AGENT → HOLD at every level. Knowledge atoms flow through the membrane, get transformed by the furnace, and exhale as enriched truth."

**External version:**
> "The platform implements a consistent Input → Processing → Output architecture at every level. Structured knowledge units flow through the integration layer, get transformed by our processing engine, and output as enriched, actionable data."

### Value Proposition

**Internal version:**
> "We help you molt—evolving your architecture when data forces it, not when feelings suggest it."

**External version:**
> "We help you evolve—upgrading your architecture when quantitative metrics indicate the need, not based on subjective assessment."
