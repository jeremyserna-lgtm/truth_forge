## THE DETECTION PROTOCOL

For each invisible:
1. **Name it** — What are we trying to detect?
2. **Watch for shadows** — What visible effects would it create?
3. **Gather evidence** — What are we observing?
4. **Calibrate confidence** — How certain are we?
5. **Note implications** — What does this mean for implementation?

**Confidence Scale:**
- **Detected (D):** Strong pattern, multiple sources
- **Indicated (I):** Pattern suggested, some ambiguity
- **Suspected (S):** Hypothesis, needs validation
- **Unknown (U):** Haven't looked / can't see
