## Research Summary

Based on current best practices ([B12](https://www.b12.io/resource-center/website-conversions/things-to-add-to-your-landing-page-for-more-conversions-2026/), [Leadfeeder](https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/landing-pages-convert/), [Powered by Search](https://www.poweredbysearch.com/blog/saas-website-best-practices/)):

### Key Principles
- **Load time matters:** 1-2 seconds optimal; each second delay = 4.42% conversion drop
- **Mobile-first:** 50% of landing pages aren't mobile-optimized (opportunity)
- **Clear value prop:** Answer "What? Who? Why?" immediately above the fold
- **Social proof early:** Testimonials/logos near hero section build trust
- **Simple forms:** Multi-step forms outperform long single forms
- **Single CTA focus:** One clear action per page section

### Essential Pages
1. Homepage (hero, value prop, features, social proof, CTA)
2. Product/Features page
3. Pricing page
4. About/Company page
5. Contact page
6. Resources/Blog (for SEO)

## About Page

### Hero

**Headline:** Built by someone who lived the credential chaos.

**Subheadline:**
> Credential Atlas wasn't designed in a vacuum. It was built by Jeremy Serna, who spent 6 years as Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, scaling credential operations from scratch.

---

### The Story

**Section Header:** Why This Exists

> I spent six years at Peterson's building their credentials product line from nothing. I scaled a team from 6 to 19 people. We doubled departmental revenue.
>
> And every single day, I watched brilliant people waste hours on credential verification that should have taken minutes. I watched compliance officers lose sleep before audits. I watched strategic decisions get made without the data to back them up.
>
> The tools didn't exist. So I built them.
>
> Credential Atlas is the system I wish I had. It's the intelligence platform that turns credential chaos into clarity.

**— Jeremy Serna, Founder**

## About Page (Truth Engine)

### Hero

**Headline:** Built by someone who got tired of generic AI.

**Subheadline:**
> Truth Engine was created by Jeremy Serna—a builder who spent years watching AI promise everything and deliver the same thing to everyone.

---

### The Philosophy

**Section Header:** Why This Exists

> I've been building data systems for over a decade. I've seen what happens when you capture knowledge well—and what happens when you don't.
>
> When I left my corporate role in 2025, I had a realization: The AI tools everyone was using didn't know anyone. They were generic by design.
>
> But what if AI could actually know you? Not in a creepy surveillance way—in a "this is your externalized brain" way?
>
> That's Truth Engine. Your knowledge, your patterns, your context—preserved and accessible.
>
> Everyone else has AI. You have you.

**— Jeremy Serna, Founder**

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

## Technology Stack Recommendations

Based on startup best practices:

### Option 1: No-Code/Low-Code (Fastest)
- **Webflow** - Design flexibility, CMS built-in
- **Framer** - Modern animations, quick deploy
- **Carrd** - Ultra-simple landing page ($19/year)

### Option 2: Framework (More Control)
- **Next.js** - React-based, great for SEO
- **Astro** - Static site, very fast
- **SvelteKit** - Modern, performant

### Option 3: Hybrid
- Marketing site on Webflow (easy updates)
- App on custom framework (when needed)

## Recommended First Build

Given current priorities:

1. **Credential Atlas landing page** (1-2 pages max)
   - Homepage with hero, value prop, features, CTA
   - Contact/demo request form
   - About section (can be on same page)

2. **Use Carrd or Webflow** for speed
   - Get live in days, not weeks
   - Iterate based on responses
   - Add pages as needed

## What NOT to Build Yet

- Blog (build when you have content strategy)
- Pricing page (until pricing is validated)
- Extensive feature pages (until product is refined)
- Customer portal (until customers exist)

## Metrics to Track

Once live:
- Page views
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- Form submissions
- Demo requests
