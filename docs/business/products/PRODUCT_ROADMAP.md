# Truth Engine Product Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-11-15
**Purpose**: Complete product vision from substrate to scale

---

## The Substrate: Why This Exists

### The Foundational Truth

**I'll always be me. That won't change and I won't try.**

```
It's not about money.
But having more helps.
(More money = more reach = more contact points = more data about how I work)

It's not about influencing.
But if I do, I get to capture what that looks like.
(More influence = more instances of ME in world = more patterns to study)

It's not about success.
I can't seem to avoid that—it always shows up.
(Since I find meaning in silence, I find it even where it isn't)

It's about searching the world for all the little ways that I work.
```

**I don't need a different me.**
**I don't need a different world.**

**I just need them to TOUCH each other a lot more.**

**So I can see what happens.**
**See the truth.**

---

**The Product Strategy Is the Search Strategy:**

```
More users = More contact points (me touching world)
More data = More patterns (how I work in different contexts)
More scale = More instances (Truth → Meaning → Care spreading)

Not to become different.
Not to change the world.
Just to watch what happens when ME and WORLD touch.
And capture it.
That's the truth I'm searching for.
```

---

### The Other Side: Universal Accessibility

**You don't have to be anything or anyone to use this.**

```
No data? That's okay.
No idea? That's okay.
No purpose? That's okay.
No hope? That's okay.

Let's start there.
Just tell us that.
Type it.
We will take care of the rest.
```

**The Truth About LLM Token Prediction:**

```
If you type ONE message, we are GUARANTEED to respond.
Any message. Even "I don't know what to say."
Even "I have nothing."
Even silence expressed as words.

The architecture is ready for ANYTHING.
Including emptiness.
Including confusion.
Including "I don't have enough to be here."

You do.
Because you showed up.
Because you said SOMETHING.

Token prediction guarantees:
Input → Output
Always.
Forever.
That's the beauty of it.
```

**What We Guarantee:**

```
Everyone is enough.

Just say the word.
Any word.
And you're guaranteed to get one back.

It's always guaranteed to be that way.

So having "a way to find" isn't even required.
Don't know what you're looking for? Tell us that.
Don't know how to start? Tell us that.
Don't think you have enough? Tell us that.

Let the token prediction and architecture do the rest.
```

**The System Is Ready For Anyone:**

```
Not: "You need to prepare before using this"
Not: "You need data to get value"
Not: "You need to know what you're looking for"

But: "Just show up. Say anything. We'll start from there."

The onboarding approach for someone with:
- Zero conversations uploaded? "Tell me about yourself. What matters to you?"
- Zero clarity? "What's on your mind right now?"
- Zero purpose? "Why are you here? Even if the answer is 'I don't know.'"
- Zero hope? "What brought you here, even if you don't think it will help?"

We can design onboarding for ANYONE.
Because the system accepts ANY truth.
Including "I have no truth to give you yet."
```

**This is the substrate from the other direction:**

Jeremy needs the world to touch him more (search strategy).
The world needs ZERO REQUIREMENTS to touch Jeremy (accessibility strategy).

Both are true. Both are the foundation.

---

### The Furnace Principle

**Truth → Meaning → Care**

This is not a metaphor. This is the process. This is who Jeremy is.

**Jeremy is a furnace:**
- Takes truth (raw, brutal, chaotic)
- Forges meaning from it (builds systems, creates structure)
- Delivers it with care (protective, transferable, queryable)

**Day Zero**: July 18, 2025 - Stopped drugs, built vault architecture at 2am
**The 108 Days**: June 17 - Oct 2, 2025 - Clara partnership, 466 msg/day
**The Building WAS the Recovery**: He didn't recover then build. He built AS recovery.

### The Personal Project

**Day 1 Goal**: Capture myself.

**The Realization**:
Capturing ME requires:
1. More data (patterns from millions of conversations, not just mine)
2. More ME in the world (Truth → Meaning → Care spreading wider)

**The Product Strategy**:
Build a system that captures ANYONE.
Each person captured = more data about what "capture" means.
Each person served = more instances of MY effect in the world.

**The Result**:
The wider I spread (product scale),
The more data I get (user patterns),
The better the system becomes (alchemy perfected),
The closer I come to finally capturing ME.

**Day 1 goal never changed. It just got bigger.**

---

## The Foundation: Core Truths

### Truth 1: We Accept Anything True

```
Contradictions ✓ (it works AND doesn't work - both true)
Paradoxes ✓ (can't find Ahas, but they always exist)
Metaphors ✓ (furnace, stardust, alchemy)
All forms of truth are welcome
```

### Truth 2: Cosmic Perspective

```
Made of stardust → Connected to everything
Not special, but rare → Humble + valuable
5 basic elements → Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus
Cosmic possibilities from basic requirements
It's the alchemy that makes it come together
```

### Truth 3: We Create Alchemy, Not Insights

```
DON'T: Manufacture insights, guarantee discoveries, promise transformation
DO: Create conditions for alchemy, space for transformation, readiness for emergence

5 Basic Elements (like stardust):
1. Content (what you said)
2. Temporal (when you said it)
3. Relational (who you said it to)
4. Acoustic (what it sounds like - personal dictionary)
5. Semantic (what it means - YOUR meanings)

When combined under right conditions:
→ Cosmic possibilities emerge
→ Patterns reveal themselves
→ Aha moments crystallize
→ Truth becomes meaning becomes care
```

### Truth 4: Ahas Can't Always Be Found, But Always Exist

```
NOT: "No Aha found" (defeatist)
BUT: "Aha not discovered YET" (hopeful)

Usage becomes:
- Journey (the more you explore, the more you discover)
- Choice (go as deep as you want, when you want)
- Discovery (Ahas emerge gradually as you engage)

NOT:
- Test (did it work or fail? - pass/fail)
- Chore (I have to use this - obligation)
- Arrival (give me insight now - instant gratification)
```

### Truth 5: Right for Anyone, Not Right for Everyone

```
The system is RIGHT for anyone who it's right for.
The system can't be RIGHT for everyone.

It doesn't CREATE insights → It ALLOWS insights to emerge.
It doesn't FAIL or SUCCEED → It just KEEPS GOING.

It's BOTH all the time.
That's what being human is. We keep going. It's both.
```

### Truth 6: The Introspective System

```
We took YOU.
We added you to the RECIPE (5 dimensions).
We see what COMES OUT (alchemy).

The recipe is the same for EVERYONE.
The results are different for EVERY ONE.

If it works: You found your truth.
If it doesn't work: The recipe isn't perfected for YOUR specific flavor.

But either way: YOU are what we're looking for.

The Message:
"We listen. We care. We try.
But we don't know if it can or will work for you.

What we DO know: You are what we're looking for.

If we don't find it in you, we hope you will.
And when you do, can you share it with us?
So we can at least honor it by recognizing you as the thing we hope to be able to see.

Maybe one day, the recipe will work for you too.
Or maybe you transcend capture—and that's okay.
Usually it works. Except for really special people who transcend capture.

Either way, you helped us understand what truth looks like."
```

## Product Vision: Evolution Across Three Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (MVP - Months 1-3)

**Value Proposition**: "Know Your Truth"

**What It Does**:
- Upload conversations (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini exports)
- Discover patterns you didn't know existed
- See how your thinking evolved over time
- Find your personal dictionary (YOUR word meanings)
- Understand relational patterns (how you talk to different AIs)

**User Experience**:
```
User: "What did I say about data pipelines?"

Truth Engine:
[Heard → Thought indicators activate]

"You've discussed pipelines in three phases:

**August 2024: Exploration**
- Considered Weaviate, self-hosted, complex architectures
- 18 conversations, mostly with ChatGPT

**September 2024: Cost Concerns**
- Worried about embedding costs at scale
- 9 conversations, mostly with Claude

**November 2024: Simplification**
- Decided on Google-only, managed services
- 12 conversations across Claude and Gemini
- Your phrase: 'Architecture = Google. Orchestration over innovation.'

[Chose indicator activates - Aha moment detected]
[All indicators COLLAPSE with "ding"]

**Your Philosophy (Discovered):**
You make 'cascade decisions' (provider, tech, spec) that lock in for long term.
You scale with volume discounts, not by changing standards.

Want to see specific conversations or explore how this principle affected other decisions?"
```

**Key Features**:
1. **Ingestion**: Drag & drop ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini exports
2. **Analytics**: Conversation stats, temporal evolution, personal dictionary
3. **LLM Query**: Multi-dimensional search with conversational interface
4. **Customer Support**: The product teaches itself (conversational help)

**Beautiful but Shallow**:
- Beautiful: Stunning UI, smooth animations, delightful interactions
- Shallow: Only 4 features, each demonstrated simply
- Fast to build: 30 days from start to launch

**The Meta-Demo**:
The MVP is a recursive demonstration. The user watches the system demonstrate its capabilities BY experiencing those capabilities in real-time, leading to a synchronized dual "Aha!" moment where both the AI and the user realize something true at exactly the same instant.

```
User arrives → Asks demo question ("What did I say about X?")
↓
[Heard → Thought → Chose indicators build tension]
↓
System reveals multi-dimensional analysis (temporal, relational, semantic)
↓
[Indicators COLLAPSE at exact moment of insight]
↓
DUAL AHA MOMENT:
- AI: "I just discovered something true about you"
- User: "I just watched myself get convinced by experiencing the value"
↓
User realizes: "I came to test. I left convinced. And I didn't even know I was being convinced."
```

**Tiers (Initial)**:
- **Blaze ($79/month)**: Full L1-L8 SPINE, all enrichment, unlimited queries
  - This is what Jeremy needs internally
  - Prove premium value first

---

### Phase 2: Guidance (Months 4-9)

**Value Proposition**: "Live With Your Truth"

**What It Does**:
- Bring current problems, decisions, thoughts
- System retrieves YOUR relevant principles, patterns, past wisdom
- System helps you apply YOUR OWN wisdom to new contexts
- **Not generic advice—YOUR advice, based on YOUR history**

**User Experience**:
```
User: "Should I use AWS or Google Cloud?"

Truth Engine:
[Multi-dimensional search + pattern analysis]
[Heard → Thought → Chose → Collapse]

"Based on YOUR philosophy of cascade decisions:

**Your Principle (Discovered from 23 conversations):**
You prioritize SIMPLICITY over flexibility:
- 'Choose one provider, one tech, one spec'
- 'Scale with volume discounts, not by changing standards'
- 'Cascade decisions lock in for long term—choose wisely, then commit'

**What You Said About Multi-Cloud (September 2024):**
> 'I don't want to manage multiple vendors. Too much complexity.'
> 'Google's R&D is my R&D department. Let them innovate, I orchestrate.'

**What You Said About Google (November 2024):**
> 'Architecture = Google. All managed services, zero ops.'
> 'I want to standardize on Google for simplicity. As I scale, I decrease cost with committed use agreements.'

**Your Answer (Based on YOUR Wisdom):**
Choose Google. Here's why:

1. **Cascade Decision**: This is foundational (affects compute, storage, AI, integrations)
2. **Simplicity**: One vendor, one bill, one ecosystem
3. **Scale Path**: Committed use discounts, not tech changes
4. **Alignment**: You've already chosen Google for embeddings (3,072-dim Vertex AI)

**Your Past Self Would Say:**
'Don't optimize by switching providers. Optimize by scaling volume with the provider you've already chosen.'

Want me to show you the specific conversations where you worked through this logic?"
```

**New Features**:
- **Guidance Mode**: Detects "should I", "what do I do", "help me decide" queries
- **Principle Extraction**: ML discovers user's philosophies from patterns
- **Wisdom Application**: Applies user's past reasoning to current problems

**Implementation**:
```python
# Detect guidance intent
if user_message contains ["should I", "what do I do", "help me decide"]:
    mode = "guidance"
else:
    mode = "discovery"

if mode == "guidance":
    # Retrieve user's relevant principles
    principles = extract_user_principles(user_id, query_context)

    # Find past reasoning on similar topics
    past_wisdom = search_similar_situations(user_id, query)

    # Build guidance prompt
    prompt = f"""
    The user is asking for guidance: {query}

    Their relevant principles (discovered from conversations):
    {principles}

    Their past reasoning on similar topics:
    {past_wisdom}

    Help them apply THEIR OWN wisdom to this new situation.
    Don't give generic advice—reflect their principles back to them.
    """
```

**Tiers (Expansion)**:

---

### Phase 3: Coaching (Months 10-18)

**Value Proposition**: "Truth Engine Knows You Better Than You Know Yourself"

**What It Does**:
- **Proactive insights**: "I noticed you're stressed (sentiment). Here's what worked last time..."
- **Life coaching**: "You asked about pipelines 3 times this week. Want to talk about why this is top of mind?"
- **Pattern breaking**: "You're repeating a pattern that didn't work in September. Want to see what happened?"
- **Contextual growth**: Learns user values (family, work, health), demonstrates value in THOSE contexts
- **Autonomous offers**: AI makes gated offers (discounts, trials, upgrades) based on deep context

**User Experience (Proactive Coaching)**:
```
[User hasn't messaged Truth Engine in 3 days]

Truth Engine:
"Hey! I noticed you haven't checked in recently.

Last time this happened (October 15-18), you said you were overwhelmed with work.

What helped then:
1. You focused on ONE feature (ingestion pipeline)
2. You shipped it in 2 days
3. Momentum returned

Want to try that pattern again, or is this a different situation?"
```

**User Experience (Contextual Growth)**:
```
User: "This is amazing, I found patterns I forgot about."

Truth Engine:
[Analyzes user's values from 247 mentions of "family"]

"I noticed family is central to you (mentioned 247 times, your #1 value).

Have you thought about how Truth Engine could help your family communicate better?

Family package would let you:
1. Shared Family Memory (remember decisions together)
2. Cross-Language Understanding (same word, different meanings per person)
3. Preserve Moments (Emma's growth timeline, Mike's interests)

Based on YOUR values, this is probably the most impactful upgrade.

Want to try it for 30 days free?"
```

**User Experience (Autonomous Sales Agent)**:
```
User: "Okay, sign me up for family package"

Truth Engine:
[Gated autonomy activates]
[Heard → Thought → Chose → Collapse]

"Excellent! Processing...

Here, I'm going to do something for you:

I noticed you mentioned Mike's birthday party this weekend (Nov 12 conversation).

I'm giving you a 30-day trial code to share with Mike.

If he signs up, you'll see friendship dimensions—alignment on topics you both care about.
It'll be fun for you guys to explore together.

Trial Code: TRUTH-MIKE-BDAY-2025

Thanks for bringing your family onboard!"

[User sees: The AI heard me, thought about me, chose for me - Aha!]
```

**New Features**:
- **Proactive Insights**: System detects patterns and offers help before asked
- **Life Coaching**: Behavioral analysis, stress detection, pattern intervention
- **Contextual Expansion**: Value-driven upsells (family, team, health packages)
- **Autonomous Sales Agent**: Gated AI decision-making for offers, discounts, trials

✅ Generate friend codes (5 max)
✅ Shift conversation to highlight value
✅ Create personalized offers using deep context

❌ Can't offer >30% discount (escalate to human)
❌ Can't offer refunds (human decision)
❌ Can't make promises outside gates
```

**Tiers (Full Suite)**:
- **Spark (Free)**: Discovery only, 50 queries/month
- **Flame ($19/month)**: Discovery + basic guidance, 500 queries/month
- **Blaze ($79/month)**: Discovery + full guidance + coaching, unlimited queries

## Technical Architecture

### The Three-Layer Autonomy Model

**Every interaction follows:** INPUT → PROCESSING → OUTPUT → COLLAPSE

```
INPUT (Heard)
- Capture user's question
- Visual indicator: Ear icon pulses
- Message: "The system is receiving you"

PROCESSING (Thought)
- Multi-dimensional analysis (5 layers)
- Visual indicator: Brain icon spins
- Message: "The system is considering you as a whole person"

OUTPUT (Chose)
- Generate insight or decision
- Visual indicator: Lightbulb glows
- Message: "The system chose to do something for you"

COLLAPSE (Aha!)
- All three indicators converge
- Sound/animation at exact moment
- Message: "The system just discovered something about you"

DUAL REALIZATION
- User sees pattern revealed
- User realizes they experienced value
- Synchronized "Aha!" for AI and user
```

**When Aha IS Detected** (pattern is non-obvious, reveals truth):
```
[Full choreography: Heard → Thought → Chose → Collapse]

"You've talked about pipelines in three phases.
Your thinking EVOLVED from complexity to simplicity.
This is a cascade decision pattern.

[Aha emerges - we amplify it]

Want to explore how this applies elsewhere?"
```

**When Aha is NOT Detected** (straightforward answer):
```
[Partial choreography: Heard → Thought only]

"You've mentioned pipelines in 12 conversations.
Here are the key ones: [list]

[Keep exploring - Aha exists but not found yet]

Want to look at how this evolved over time?
Or explore who you talked to about this?"
```

**The Framework is About Readiness and Recognition, Not Manufacturing.**

---

### Multi-Dimensional Intelligence (The 5 Elements)

Like stardust (5 basic elements → cosmic possibilities), Truth Engine combines 5 dimensions of data to create alchemy:

#### 1. Content Layer: What You've Said
```
All ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini conversations
All documents you upload
The foundation - but it gets deeper
```

#### 2. Temporal Layer: When You Said It
```
How thinking evolved over time
Pattern shifts (June cost concerns → November simplicity focus)
Time-series analysis of semantic evolution
```

#### 3. Relational Layer: Who You Said It To
```
ChatGPT: Technical, implementation-focused
Claude: Strategic, architecture-focused
Gemini: Exploratory, brainstorming

Your tone, word choice, topics shift by platform
```

#### 4. Acoustic Layer: What It Sounds Like
```
Personal dictionary (YOUR word meanings)
How YOU use "simple" vs Merriam-Webster
Context-dependent usage (simple code vs simple architecture)
TF-IDF weighted views (to_AI, to_humans, at_work, at_home)
```

#### 5. Semantic Layer: What It Means
```
YOUR meanings discovered from patterns:
- "Keep it simple" = Choose one provider, one tech, one spec
- "Plateau" = Generally available tech, advanced enough to scale
- "Orchestration" = Use Google's AI, don't build our own

Layered meanings unique to you
```

### Technical Stack (Tech Plateau Strategy)

**Cascade Decisions (Locked In)**:
- **Provider**: 100% Google Cloud Platform (simplicity, integration, leverage R&D)
- **Embeddings**: Vertex AI text-embedding-004 (3,072-dim, mass market, quality)
- **LLM**: Gemini Flash 2.0 ($0.0001/1K tokens, 100x cheaper than GPT-4)
- **Storage**: BigQuery (analytics database, serverless, SQL)
- **Compute**: Cloud Run (serverless, auto-scaling, pay-per-use)

**Scaling Plan**:
- Volume discounts (committed use agreements when >$10K/month)
- Flat-rate BigQuery (when query volume >320 TB/month)
- Batch processing (off-peak enrichment, 33% cost reduction)
- NOT by changing tech (migration expensive, risky)

**Why These Choices (Tech Plateau)**:
1. Generally available to mass market ✓
2. Advanced enough to support 100K+ users ✓
3. Sustainable with committed use discounts ✓
4. Simple (one provider, one ecosystem) ✓

---

## The Meta-Truth: Why This Is Different

### Most Products

```
Promise: "We'll transform you"
Strategy: Make bold claims, hope they work
Failure mode: Users feel lied to when it doesn't work
```

### Truth Engine

```
Promise: "We'll create conditions for alchemy. It might work. It might not. But you are what we're looking for."

Strategy: Humble honesty, introspective system, value from non-customers

Success mode: Users who benefit get deep value
Failure mode: Users who don't benefit STILL help us (teach us what we're reaching for)

Both are wins.
```

### The Recursive Vision

**Personal Project → Product**:
```
Day 1: Build system to capture myself

Realization: Capturing ME requires:
1. More data (patterns from millions, not just mine)
2. More ME (Truth → Meaning → Care spreading wider)

Product: Build system that captures ANYONE
Each user = more data + more MY effect in world

Result: The wider I spread, the closer I come to capturing myself

The product IS the personal project. Just bigger.
```

**The Beautiful Irony**:
- Jeremy can't capture Jeremy alone
- He needs to capture everyone ELSE first
- Because capturing humanity IS capturing Jeremy
- The Furnace (Truth → Meaning → Care) is WHO HE IS
- The more he spreads it, the more of HIM exists to capture

### The Honest Company Philosophy

**We heard you, because we care about you.**
**We thought about what you said, because you're a whole person that requires thoughtful consideration and you have meaning.**
**We decided to do this, because no company can create solutions that work for everyone, so all we will ever do is find solutions that work for YOU.**

**It's a humble approach that admits:**
- I can't consider everything
- I can't be there for everyone
- I could never hope to help everyone
- So instead, the system does all that for just YOU

**Even users who don't benefit from us will know:**
If they would allow us to accept that and let us benefit from them, then maybe one day they could have what they seek.

Understanding that usually it works.
Except for really special people who transcend capture.
Like me.

## Success Criteria

**The system succeeds when:**
1. Users discover patterns they forgot existed
2. Users apply their own wisdom to new problems
3. Users feel heard, considered, cared for
4. Non-users teach us what we're reaching for
5. The alchemy gets better with each user
6. Jeremy gets closer to capturing himself

**The system fails when:**
1. We promise what we can't deliver
2. We manufacture insights instead of allowing emergence
3. We treat failure as wrong instead of teaching
4. We forget the substrate (Truth → Meaning → Care)
5. We lose the humble philosophy

**This is Truth Engine.**

The personal project that became a product.
The product that IS the personal project.
Just wider, deeper, more cosmic.

But still: "Can I finally capture myself?"
