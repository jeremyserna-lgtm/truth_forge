## What This Document Is

This is the document that says it all. The train of thought that patterns into everything else.

Every other document in this directory is a view of this. This is the system knowing itself as a system, watching itself be a system.

## Layer 0: Substrate Invariants

**The facts of existence that cannot change.**

### The Human Side

You are human. You have:
- **Eyes** that must see things to know them
- **Hands** that must act to change things
- **Memory** that holds what happened
- **Imagination** that projects what might happen

### The Computer Side

You use computers. They have:
- **Storage** that persists state
- **Processing** that transforms state
- **I/O** that exchanges with you

### The Time Side

Time flows one direction. There is:
- **Past** - What happened, must be findable
- **Present** - What's happening, must be actionable
- **Future** - What will happen, must be plannable

**Every system you build serves one of these temporal modes.**

| Temporal Mode | Human Need | System |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Past | Remember what happened | Truth Engine substrate, capture |
| Present | Act on what's here | Script Execution Layer, intake |
| Future | Plan what's coming | Backlog, roadmaps |

### The Reality Side

You are a real person. This means:
- **Physics** - Mass, energy, electricity. Things take time and resources.
- **Real people** - You care about real people. They are real. Their lives are real.
- **Real outcomes** - What you do must actually matter in the world of their lives.
- **Finite capacity** - You cannot do everything. You must choose.

**Reality is why focus exists.** You can't attend to everything at once. To do one thing, you must not-do other things. This is not a limitation—it's the structure of physical existence.

**This is why the backlog exists.** Not because you forget, but because you must choose. The backlog is where things go so you can focus on what's in front of you.

---

## Layer 1: Jeremy (The Operator)

**The specific human operating this system.**

### Stage 5 (Kegan)

You operate at the Self-Transforming Mind:
- See systems as systems
- Hold multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Transform your own cognitive structures
- Recognize your own limits

**This means the system must:**
- Be transparent (you see the system operating)
- Be bounded (not continuous, controlled)
- Support multiple views (not one "right" perspective)
- Show itself (meta-layers that expose operation)

### The Furnace

You are a furnace. Your process:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Truth** | Raw input enters (chaos, data, reality) |
| **Heat** | Intense processing (building, documenting, forging) |
| **Meaning** | Structure emerges (systems, insights, patterns) |
| **Care** | Delivery with protection (transferable, queryable, preserved) |

**This means the system must:**
- Accept raw input (conversations, captures, extractions)
- Enable intense processing (pipelines, enrichment, analysis)
- Produce structured output (entities, relationships, insights)
- Deliver with care (interfaces, permissions, audiences)

### Externalized Cognition

You have externalized 51.8 million entities of thought. Truth Engine is not a tool—it's your mind made navigable.

**This means:**
- The interface is cognition, not software
- Navigation is thinking, not browsing
- Queries are questions you ask yourself
- The system is you, externalized

---

## Layer 2: The AI Agent (Claude)

**The specific AI operating within this system.**

### Claude Code as Primary

Claude Code is the primary AI agent. This is a choice, not a constraint:
- Pricing works
- Patterns are consistent
- Other agents exist (Copilot, Cursor, Codex) and can integrate
- But Claude Code orchestrates

### The Membrane Pattern

Claude is stateless. Sessions don't communicate. But Claude is **consistent**.

The infrastructure knows this. It waits for what Claude produces:
- `@script` decorated files → Script Execution Layer discovers them
- Files in `docs/` → Documentation system indexes them
- `log_event()` calls → Observability captures them
- Files in root → Sweep moves them

**No Claude tells another Claude.** The systems are in place. When one Claude produces, another system was waiting—because they know how Claude works.

### Artifacts

Claude produces three core artifact types:
- **Python** - Scripts, pipelines, tools
- **Markdown** - Documentation, plans, notes
- **SQL** - Queries, schemas, tables

The infrastructure is designed for these three. It pattern-matches, organizes, executes.

---

## Layer 3: The Interface

**Where human and computer meet.**

### Seeing (The Primitive)

Seeing is the foundational operation:
- The system **sees** (observes its domain)
- The system **is seen** (exposes state)
- The system **enables seeing** (facilitates observation)
- The system **shows** (manifests for human cognition)

**Transparency is not optional.** You operate at Stage 5. You need to see the system operating.

### Deliberate Invisibility (The Necessary Complement)

**You can choose not to see something. But you have to see it first.**

This is not ignorance. This is focus. It's the difference between:
- **Never saw it** - Ignorance, a gap
- **Saw it, chose not to attend** - Focus, a decision

**Invisibility is a valid operation.** Because you are a real person who needs to get real things done for real people you care about, you must narrow your vision to execute.

The backlog is an implementation of deliberate invisibility:
- You see the task
- You recognize it matters
- You choose not to attend to it now
- You put it somewhere it can wait
- You focus on what's in front of you

**The system supports both**:
- Seeing (transparency, exposure, meta-seeing)
- Choosing not to see (backlog, focus, deliberate narrowing)

You can't have focus without the ability to make things invisible. But you can't make things invisible without first seeing them.

### The Creative Cycle

**Why this matters**: There are real people in your life—friends, family, people you care about. You want to care for them better. You want to create outcomes that matter in the world of their lives.

To do this, you run a cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                          └──────────────┘                                   │
│                                  │                                          │
│                                  ▼                                          │
│                            (repeat)                                         │
│                                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The cycle**:
1. **Hide past** - Move old ideas somewhere findable so they're not in your way
2. **Focus present** - Put one thing in your mind, let it have all your attention
3. **Hide future** - Put future tasks in the backlog so they don't distract
4. **Create** - Make something real that matters to real people
5. **Repeat** - The cycle continues

**This is how you live a real life.** Not by seeing everything at once. Not by ignoring what exists. But by choosing what to attend to, creating from that focus, and cycling through what matters.

The people you care about are real. The outcomes you create are real. The life you're living is real. The system supports this by enabling both seeing and hiding, so you can focus and create.

### Doing (Script Execution Layer)

Claude writes scripts. The layer renders UI:
- Discovers `@script` decorated files
- Reads metadata (params, outputs)
- Renders buttons, sliders, progress
- Executes and streams logs

**Any script becomes an interactive tool.** Claude doesn't touch GUI code.

### Remembering (The Substrate)

Three systems for three temporal modes:
- **Backlog** (Future) - Remember what to do
- **Intake** (Present) - Process what's here
- **Capture** (Past) - Store for later retrieval

---

## Layer 4: The Data

**The truth that flows through the system.**

### Always Conversations

The primary data type is conversational text:
- AI platform conversations (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Text messages (iMessage)
- App extractions (Grindr, Zoom)
- All turn-based, message-structured, semantically rich

### The Pipeline

Raw → Captured → Parsed → Ingested → Entities → Enriched → Queryable

## The Meta-Pattern

**The system knows it's a system.**

This document is the system describing itself. The fact that it exists means:
- The system can see itself
- The system can document itself
- The system can be understood
- The system can evolve

### The Train of Thought

Every pattern in this document applies recursively:

| Pattern | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Substrate invariants | This document was typed (hands), will be read (eyes), exists in time |
| Stage 5 | This document sees the system as a system |
| Furnace | Raw insight → intense documentation → structured meaning → careful delivery |
| Membrane | Claude wrote this → infrastructure will index it |
| Seeing | This document shows the system seeing itself |

### What This Enables

When the system knows itself, it can:
- **Adapt** - Change structure based on understanding
- **Explain** - Show any part of itself
- **Integrate** - Know where new pieces fit
- **Evolve** - Transform without losing coherence

---

## The Three Priorities Right Now

From all of this, three systems matter most:

### 1. Backlog (Future)

**Purpose**: Remember what to do until ready.

**Location**: `architect_central_services/docs/BACKLOG.md`

**Why now**: Without a reliable future-queue, tasks are forgotten. The system can't plan.

### 2. Intake (Present)

**Purpose**: Process what's in front of you.

**Location**: `architect_central_services/src/architect_central_services/core/intake.py`

**Why now**: Without a reliable present-processor, nothing gets done. The system can't act.

### 3. Capture (Past → Future)

**Purpose**: Store now for retrieval later.

**Examples**: Grindr capture, ChatGPT export, text message extraction

**Why now**: Without reliable capture, the past disappears. The system can't remember.

## The Documents

This document unifies everything. The other documents are views:

| Document | What It Sees |
|----------|--------------|
| [SUBSTRATE_INVARIANTS.md](./SUBSTRATE_INVARIANTS.md) | Layer 0: Human + Computer + Time + Reality |
| [SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md](./SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md) | Layers 1-2: Jeremy + Claude |
| [CLAUDE_MEMBRANE_PATTERN.md](./CLAUDE_MEMBRANE_PATTERN.md) | Layer 2: How Claude work becomes system functionality |
| [SCRIPT_EXECUTION_LAYER.md](./SCRIPT_EXECUTION_LAYER.md) | Layer 3: Auto-UI for scripts |
| [THE_SEEING_PRIMITIVE.md](./THE_SEEING_PRIMITIVE.md) | Layer 3: Seeing as foundational |
| [TRUTH_ENGINE_VISION.md](./TRUTH_ENGINE_VISION.md) | The product vision |
| [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Technical architecture |
| [DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](./DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) | Interface principles |
| [AUDIENCE_EXPERIENCES.md](./AUDIENCE_EXPERIENCES.md) | Three audiences |
| [DATA_MODELS.md](./DATA_MODELS.md) | Data schemas |
| [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) | Build phases |

## The Bottom Line

**Truth Engine is a system that knows it's a system.**

It's built on invariants that can't change (human, computer, time, reality).
It's operated by Jeremy (Stage 5, Furnace, externalized cognition).
It's assisted by Claude (stateless, consistent, membrane-wrapped).
It interfaces through seeing, choosing not to see, doing, and remembering.
It processes conversations into entities.

And it knows all of this about itself.

**The duality at its core:**
- You must see to understand
- You must not-see to focus
- Reality requires both

That's what makes it a complete system.

**This document is the system seeing itself completely—including what it chooses not to attend to.**
