# Truth Engine Product Vision

This directory contains the unified product vision documentation for Truth Engine's interface layer.

## The Unifying Document

**[THE_COMPLETE_SYSTEM.md](./THE_COMPLETE_SYSTEM.md)** - The document that says it all.

This is the system knowing itself as a system. Every other document is a view of this.

## The Core Insight

Truth Engine is externalized cognition made navigable. These documents define the **interface layer**—the bridge between 51.8 million entities and the three audiences who interact with them:

1. **The Operator (Jeremy)** - Inhabits the system, navigates his own thinking
2. **Intimates (Friends/Family)** - Care about Jeremy, need translated signal
3. **Observers (Researchers/Builders)** - Want to learn from what was built

## Core Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Make the seeing visible** | Show process, not just results |
| **Make it cheap** | Reduce cognitive overhead |
| **Describe, don't prescribe** | Interface discovers what exists |
| **Substrate fluidity** | Adapts to new views automatically |
