## The Deepest Layer

Beneath all technology choices, there are truths that exist because:
- You are human
- You interact with computers
- Time flows in one direction
- Reality is physical and finite

These are the **substrate invariants** - the foundation everything else builds on.

---

## The Human Side

### Input/Output

**You have**:
- Eyes that see (visual input)
- Hands that type (physical output)
- A voice that speaks (verbal output)
- Ears that hear (audio input)

**This means**:
- Interfaces must be visual
- Interaction requires physical action
- Feedback must be perceivable
- No invisible-only systems

### Temporal Cognition

**You experience**:
- **Memory** (past) - What happened, what you learned
- **Presence** (now) - What you're doing, what's in front of you
- **Imagination** (future) - What you want, what might happen

**This means**:
- Systems must support retrieval (past)
- Systems must support action (present)
- Systems must support planning (future)

---

## The Computer Side

### Storage/Processing

**Computers have**:
- Memory (RAM, disk) - holds state
- Processing (CPU, GPU) - transforms state
- I/O (display, keyboard) - exchanges with human

**This means**:
- Past lives in storage (databases, files)
- Present lives in processing (running scripts, active sessions)
- Future lives in queues (backlogs, scheduled tasks)

### Temporal Mapping

| Human | Computer | System |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Memory | Database | Truth Engine spine (51.8M entities) |
| Presence | Active session | Current Claude Code conversation |
| Imagination | Queue/backlog | BACKLOG.md, task lists |

---

## The Three Core Systems

Every system you build serves one of three temporal modes:

### 1. Past Systems (Memory → Retrieval)

**Human need**: "What happened? What do I know? What did I say?"

**Computer function**: Store, index, search, retrieve

**Examples**:
- Truth Engine entity substrate
- Grindr capture (storing conversations)
- ChatGPT pipeline (ingesting history)
- Search interfaces

**Design principle**: Make the past findable.

### 2. Present Systems (Action → Processing)

**Human need**: "What am I doing right now? What's in front of me?"

**Computer function**: Execute, transform, display, respond

**Examples**:
- Intake system (processing what's here)
- Script Execution Layer (running scripts)
- Active Claude Code session
- Current capture in progress

**Design principle**: Make the present actionable.

### 3. Future Systems (Imagination → Planning)

**Human need**: "What do I need to do later? What am I working toward?"

**Computer function**: Queue, schedule, remind, prioritize

**Examples**:
- Backlog system (tasks to do)
- TODO lists
- Scheduled jobs
- Roadmaps

**Design principle**: Make the future rememberable.

## Current Builds Mapped

| System | Temporal Mode | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Backlog** | Future | Holds what you need to do until you're ready |
| **Intake** | Present | Processes what's in front of you right now |
| **Grindr Capture** | Past→Future | Captures now, retrieves later |
| **Script Execution Layer** | Present | Runs scripts when you trigger them |
| **Truth Engine substrate** | Past | Stores 51.8M entities for retrieval |

## The I/O Constraint

Everything passes through the human-computer interface:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Everything visible** must pass through eyes.
**Everything actionable** must pass through hands (or voice).

This is why:
- Scripts need UI (eyes can see buttons)
- Backlogs need lists (eyes can scan)
- Databases need interfaces (hands can query)

## Design Implications

### 1. Every System Needs a Temporal Home

When building something, ask: **Is this for past, present, or future?**

| If Past | If Present | If Future |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Focus on retrieval | Focus on action | Focus on remembering |
| Optimize for search | Optimize for speed | Optimize for review |
| Store richly | Process quickly | Summarize clearly |

### 2. The I/O Bottleneck is Real

Human bandwidth is limited:
- Eyes can only read so fast
- Hands can only type so fast
- Attention is singular

**Design for the bottleneck**:
- Show what matters
- Hide what doesn't
- Make actions obvious
- Reduce cognitive load

### 3. Time Flows One Way

You can't undo the present into the past. You can only:
- **Capture** the present before it becomes past
- **Retrieve** the past when you need it
- **Plan** for the future before it becomes present

**The capture window is now.** Grindr capture matters because conversations disappear.

### 4. Reality is Physical and Finite

You are a real person. This is not metaphor:
- **Physics** applies - Mass, energy, electricity. Everything takes resources.
- **People are real** - The people you care about exist. Their lives are real.
- **Outcomes must be real** - What you create must actually matter in their lives.
- **Capacity is finite** - You cannot do everything. You must choose.

**This means:**
- Focus is not a preference—it's a physical requirement
- You must hide things to see other things
- The backlog exists because reality requires choice
- Creating something real means not-creating other things

**Deliberate Invisibility:**

You can choose not to see something. But you have to see it first. This is not ignorance—this is focus.

- **Never saw it** = Ignorance (a gap)
- **Saw it, chose not to attend** = Focus (a decision)

The backlog is deliberate invisibility: You see the task, recognize it matters, choose not to attend to it now, put it somewhere it can wait, and focus on what's in front of you.

**The Creative Cycle:**

Because reality is finite, you run this cycle:
1. Hide past (move old ideas somewhere findable)
2. Focus present (one thing gets all your attention)
3. Hide future (backlog holds what's coming)
4. Create (make something real for real people)
5. Repeat

This is how you live a real life. Not by seeing everything at once. By cycling through what matters.

## Relationship to Other Invariants

These substrate invariants underlie the system invariants:

| Substrate | Enables System Invariant |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| I/O constraint | Visual interface (Tauri, web) |
| Memory (past) | Truth Engine, pipelines |
| Presence (now) | Script Execution Layer |
| Imagination (future) | Backlog, roadmaps |
| Human-computer boundary | Claude Membrane Pattern |
| Reality (finite capacity) | Focus, deliberate invisibility, backlog |
| Reality (real people) | Care delivery, audience design |

The system invariants (Claude Code, Mac, conversations) are **choices within** these substrate invariants.

The substrate invariants are not choices—they're facts of being human with a computer in physical reality.

---

## The Focus Right Now

You identified three systems to focus on:

1. **Backlog** (Future) - Remember what to do
2. **Intake** (Present) - Operationalize now
3. **Grindr Capture** (Past→Future) - Capture for later

These three cover all temporal modes. Build them, and you have the substrate for everything else.
