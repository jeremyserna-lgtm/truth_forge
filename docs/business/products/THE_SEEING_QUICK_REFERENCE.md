# THE SEEING — QUICK REFERENCE
## Eight Dimensions × Five Implementation Zones

---

## THE EIGHT DIMENSIONS

### 1. BOUNDARY (Internal / External)
**Ask:** Where does the organization end?

| Internal | External | Membrane |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Operations, teams, culture, systems | Market, customers, competitors, partners | Sales, marketing, support—where they meet |

**Key Question:** How does information/value flow across the boundary?

---

### 2. SUBSTRATE (Human / Technology)
**Ask:** What's it made of?

| Human | Technology | Interface |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| People, relationships, knowledge, culture | Systems, tools, data, infrastructure | Where humans and tech meet |

**Key Question:** Where do humans adapt to tech vs. tech adapt to humans?

---

### 3. TIME (Past / Present / Future)
**Ask:** Where has it been, is it, and is it going?

| Past | Present | Future |
|------|---------|--------|
| History, patterns, legacy, wounds | Current state, active dynamics, live issues | Direction, aspirations, potential |

**Key Question:** What patterns from the past are shaping the present and constraining the future?

---

### 4. VISIBILITY (Private / Public)
**Ask:** What's hidden vs. shown?

| Private | Public | Membrane |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Confidential, proprietary, internal-only | Market-facing, transparent, shared | What crosses and how it's managed |

**Key Question:** What needs to stay private? What could become more accessible?

---

### 5. FORMALITY (Formal / Informal)
**Ask:** What's documented vs. actual?

| Formal | Informal | The Gap |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Policies, procedures, official processes | Actual practice, workarounds, real relationships | Where reality diverges from documentation |

**Key Question:** Where is the gap between formal and informal, and what does it reveal?

---

### 6. KNOWLEDGE (Explicit / Tacit)
**Ask:** What's written vs. known?

| Explicit | Tacit | Transfer |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Documented, captured, transferable | Embodied expertise, intuition, uncodified | How knowledge moves between forms |

**Key Question:** What tacit knowledge is critical and at risk? What should be codified?

---

### 7. SCALE (Individual / Collective)
**Ask:** Person patterns vs. group patterns?

| Individual | Collective | Emergence |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Personal patterns, individual capability | Group patterns, organizational behavior | How individual becomes collective |

**Key Question:** What level should we intervene at? Who are the key individuals?

---

### 8. FLOW (Static / Dynamic)
**Ask:** What moves vs. stays?

| Static | Dynamic | Rhythm |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Stable structures, persistent patterns | Movement, change, flux | Cycles, oscillations, tempo |

**Key Question:** What's the organization's capacity and rhythm for change?

## THE FIVE IMPLEMENTATION ZONES

### 1. LANDING — Where the seed enters
- Entry point selection
- Champion identification
- Quick win definition
- Risk assessment

### 2. ROOTING — How it establishes foundation
- Data connections
- System integrations
- Workflow fit
- Trust building

### 3. GROWING — How it expands capability
- Capability roadmap
- User adoption
- Value accumulation
- Pattern recognition

### 4. INTEGRATING — How it becomes part of the organism
- Workflow integration
- Knowledge integration
- Cultural acceptance
- Governance

### 5. EVOLVING — How it transforms with the organization
- Adaptation mechanisms
- Feedback loops
- Molting readiness
- Future alignment

## THE SYNTHESIS

### After Seeing All Dimensions, Identify:

1. **THE BOTTLENECK** — Where do dimensions converge on constraint?
2. **THE PATTERNS** — What themes appear across multiple dimensions?
3. **THE EXTENSION POINTS** — Where can AI extend capability?
4. **THE CONFIDENCE LANDSCAPE** — Where are we certain vs. uncertain?
5. **THE FIRST BUILD** — What addresses the bottleneck and proves value?

## ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS BY DIMENSION

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Boundary | How does work flow in and out? |
| Substrate | Who does what, and what systems support them? |
| Time | What got them here, and where are they going? |
| Visibility | What's confidential vs. shared? |
| Formality | What's documented vs. what actually happens? |
| Knowledge | What's captured vs. what's in people's heads? |
| Scale | Who are the key people, and what are the group patterns? |
| Flow | What's changing, what's stable, what's the rhythm? |

---

## THE SEEING SESSION (Abbreviated)

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Frame | 5 min | Set context, explain dimensions |
| Boundary | 15 min | Internal/External |
| Substrate | 20 min | Human/Technology |
| Time | 15 min | Past/Present/Future |
| Visibility | 10 min | Private/Public |
| Formality | 10 min | Formal/Informal |
| Knowledge | 10 min | Explicit/Tacit |
| Scale | 10 min | Individual/Collective |
| Flow | 10 min | Static/Dynamic |
| Synthesis | 20 min | Patterns, bottleneck, recommendation |

**Total: ~2 hours (org) / 90 min (abbreviated)**
