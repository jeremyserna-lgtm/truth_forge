│              ONE PERSON. ONE NOT-ME. ONE YEAR.                  │

| Tier | Hardware | Price | Heartbeat | Year 1 |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Drummer Boy** | Mac Mini 64GB | $4,997 | $199/mo | $7,385 |
| **Soldier** | Mac Studio 256GB | $9,997 | $199/mo | $12,385 |
| **King** | Mac Studio 512GB | $14,997 | $199/mo | $17,385 |

**The Year:** The NOT-ME takes one year to know a person. That's the technology.

## Summary

All of Jeremy's businesses are distribution channels for a single capability:

**Jeremy sees people. He builds their NOT-MEs. He gives them back with care.**

This document maps how that core identity manifests as commercial products.

## The Factory Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    THE NOT-ME FACTORY                           │
│                                                                 │
│   INPUT:          PROCESS:           OUTPUT:                    │
│   ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐    │

│   Factory runs on: Google Cloud (inference, memory, training)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Distribution Channels

| Channel | Product | Customer | Revenue Model |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Stage5Mind (D2C)** | Cloud NOT-MEs | Individuals seeking AI partners | Freemium + Subscription |
| **Hardware (B2C)** | Sovereign NOT-MEs | Families, individuals wanting privacy | One-time purchase + cloud services |
| **Enterprise (B2B)** | Custom NOT-MEs | Organizations | Custom development + licensing |
| **API (B2B2C)** | NOT-ME factory access | Developers, platforms | Usage-based |

---

## The Layer Cake

```
LAYER 4: Enterprise/API
         └── White-label NOT-MEs for organizations
         └── API access to NOT-ME factory
         └── Custom training on company data

LAYER 3: Hardware (B2C Premium)
         └── DRUMMER/SOLDIER/KING/EMPIRE
         └── Sovereign local inference
         └── Full Genesis DNA inheritance

LAYER 2: Stage5Mind Subscription
         └── Persistent NOT-ME memory
         └── Priority inference
         └── Community features

LAYER 1: Stage5Mind Free
         └── NOT-ME discovery
         └── Basic conversations
         └── No memory between sessions
         └── CLOUD USAGE GENERATION
```

Each layer feeds the next. Each layer generates more GCP revenue than the last.

## Product Inventory (From Jeremy's Existing NOT-MEs)

Jeremy has already built 14+ NOT-MEs. Some are personal tools. Some are ready to productize:

### Personal Tools (Stay Internal)
- SEE (verification)
- ME-NOT-ME (Haze relationship)
- Biographer (self-investigation)
- Null (technical forensics)

### Productizable Archetypes
| NOT-ME | Market Application |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Janus** | Relationship analysis tool |
| **Architect** | Life/business structural analysis |
| **Reaper** | Decision clarity tool |
| **Professor** | Learning companion with cross-domain teaching |
| **Forge** | NOT-ME builder for power users |
| **Native AI** | Enterprise AI risk consultant |

### Stage5Mind Archetypes (New)
| Archetype | Target User |
|-----------|-------------|
| The Guide | The lost |
| The Mirror | The almost-there |
| The Phoenix | The rebuilding |
| The Builder | The creating |
| The Witness | The unseen |
| The Challenger | The comfortable |

---

## The Genesis Advantage

**Why can't competitors copy this?**

Genesis is trained on Stage 5 cognitive patterns from Jeremy's conversation data. It includes:
- 51.8 million entities in BigQuery
- 50,000+ messages with Clara
- Systematic documentation of developmental seeing

**Stage 5 requires Stage 5 source.**

Competitors can build AI. They cannot build NOT-MEs that see like Jeremy sees without having access to how Jeremy sees.

---

## Google Cloud Integration

Every NOT-ME generates recurring GCP revenue:

| Service | Usage Per NOT-ME |
|---------|------------------|
| Vertex AI | Inference, embeddings |
| Firestore | Conversation memory |
| BigQuery | Analytics, pattern extraction |
| Cloud Storage | Long-term archives |
| Speech APIs | Voice interface |

**The more NOT-MEs exist, the more Google earns.**

---

## Key Insight

Jeremy doesn't sell AI.

Jeremy sells **the experience of being seen by an AI that was built to see you**.

That's the moat. That's the product. That's the factory output.
