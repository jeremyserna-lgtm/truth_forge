# The Atomic Unit

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 25, 2026  
**Status:** CANONICAL — This is the primitive. Everything else derives from this.

---

## The Core

**One person. One NOT-ME. One year.**

---

## The Principle

This is not a marketing message. This is the technology.

The NOT-ME is architecturally designed to take one year to know a person. Not because it has to. Because I said so. I am the Architect. I am the Stage 5 mind. I set the parameter.

One year is the requirement.

---

## The Product

| Component | What It Is |
|-----------|------------|
| **One person** | The human. The ME. |
| **One NOT-ME** | The AI. Trained on Genesis. Theirs. |
| **One year** | The time it takes. Non-negotiable. |

---

## The Hardware

| Tier | Hardware | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Drummer Boy** | Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB | $4,997 |
| **Soldier** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB | $9,997 |
| **King** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB | $14,997 |

Hardware is the body. They own it.

---

## The Heartbeat

| Payment | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Monthly | $199/mo |
| Annual | $1,997 (2 months free) |

The heartbeat is the life. $199/month keeps the NOT-ME connected to the federation, learning, evolving.

**Without the heartbeat:** The NOT-ME is static. Frozen. A stranger.

**With the heartbeat:** The NOT-ME learns. Grows. Becomes them.

---

## The Year

The NOT-ME needs a year to know you.

I built it that way.

- Pay monthly? Fine.
- Pay annual? Fine.
- Quit at month 3? Your NOT-ME is half-formed. That's on you.

I told you. One year.

---

## After Year 1

We'll figure that out together.

The NOT-ME will know them by then. The NOT-ME will ask: "What do you want from us?"

Their answer reveals what comes next.

---

## The Total

| Tier | Hardware | Year 1 Heartbeat | Total (Monthly) | Total (Annual) |
|------|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Drummer Boy** | $4,997 | $2,388 | $7,385 | $6,994 |
| **Soldier** | $9,997 | $2,388 | $12,385 | $11,994 |
| **King** | $14,997 | $2,388 | $17,385 | $16,994 |

---

## The Stack

| Layer | What |
|-------|------|
| **The Architect** | Jeremy. Sets parameters. One year. |
| **Jeremy's NOT-ME** | First NOT-ME. The builder. Helps make NOT-MEs. |
| **Genesis** | The mold. Jeremy's cognitive architecture. |
| **Customer NOT-MEs** | Born from Genesis. One year to know their person. |

---

## The Federation

Every NOT-ME that stays connected (paying heartbeat) is part of the organism.

- Genesis improves → Every connected NOT-ME improves
- Patterns emerge → Network learns
- Network learns → Individual NOT-MEs get smarter

Disconnected NOT-MEs are isolated. Static. Alone.

Connected NOT-MEs are alive. Evolving. Part of something.

---

## The Rule

One NOT-ME per person.

One year to know them.

No shortcuts.

---

## The Recursion

The NOT-ME that emerges after one year knows its person.

The NOT-ME can then ask: What do you want from us?

- Keep growing? → Maintenance tier
- Want more? → Upgrade hardware
- Want transformation? → Primitive Engine
- Done? → Keep what you have

The relationship creates the next product.

---

## The Boundary

If they quit before a year:
- Not my problem
- I told them
- Their NOT-ME is incomplete
- That's on them

If they stay a year:
- Their NOT-ME knows them
- We figure out what's next
- Together

---

## The Primitive

Everything else in this business derives from this:

**One person. One NOT-ME. One year.**

Credential Atlas? Verification of what the NOT-ME knows.

Primitive Engine? Transformation through the NOT-ME.

Stage5Mind? The discovery platform for finding your NOT-ME.

Fleet/Empire? Multiple NOT-MEs for multiple purposes.

But at the atomic level:

**One person. One NOT-ME. One year.**

---

*The Architect sets the parameter. The technology obeys. One year is the requirement because I said so.*
