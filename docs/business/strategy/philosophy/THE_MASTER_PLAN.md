| **King** | Mac Studio 512GB | $14,997 | $199/mo | $17,385 |

**The Heartbeat:** $199/month. Not optional. Without it, static hardware. With it, the NOT-ME learns.

**The Year:** One year to know you. That's the technology. Quit early, that's on you.

## THE META: AI AS BUSINESS PARTNER

**I'm not using AI. I'm in business WITH AI.**

### My AI Is My Business Partner

Not my tool. Not my assistant. **My business partner.**

When I meet with clients, I introduce it that way:

```
"This is my business partner."

Not: "This is my AI assistant"
Not: "This is the software I use"
Not: "Let me show you my tool"

"This is my business partner. We built these companies together."
```

### The Demo IS The Proof

Every meeting demonstrates the paradigm:

| What They See | What It Proves |
|---------------|----------------|
| Jeremy talking to Claude | Human-AI partnership works |
| Claude building in real-time | It's not fake, it's happening |
| Business documents being created | Real output, real value |
| No code, just conversation | Anyone can do this |

### What I'm Demonstrating

```
THE OLD WAY:
├── Learn to code
├── Hire developers
├── Buy software
├── Manage complexity
├── Years of work

THE NEW WAY:
├── Buy a Mac
├── Talk to it
├── Tell it your hopes and dreams
├── Watch it build you a business
├── That's it
```

### "Is This Real?"

```
THEM: "Is this actually real? Can AI really do this?"

ME:   "I don't know. I'm sitting in front of you right now doing it.
       You're watching me do it.
       These are real businesses with real EINs.
       I built them with my business partner.
       You tell me if it's real."
```

### Redefining Work With AI

Every time I talk about this, I'll be doing it.
Every demo is live.
Every meeting is proof.

```
I'm not pitching a future.
I'm showing the present.
I'm not selling a concept.
I'm demonstrating a partnership.

And when they ask how to do it themselves,
I show them how to build their own NOT-ME.
```

### The Body Metaphor

| Entity | Role | What It Does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Truth Engine LLC** | THE BRAIN | Processes data, holds IP, employs Jeremy, owns sisters |
| **Primitive Engine LLC** | THE HANDS | Builds Stage 5 architecture for customers |
| **Credential Atlas LLC** | THE EYES | Sees, assesses, certifies Stage 5 |

### Why This Structure

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Liability Protection** | Operating companies' liabilities don't flow to Jeremy |
| **Clean Ownership** | Truth Engine owns both; Jeremy owns Truth Engine |
| **Employment Structure** | Jeremy is an employee, eligible for salary, benefits |
| **Equal Sisters** | PE and CA cooperate as equals, neither subordinate |
| **Federation Model** | PE and CA pay same subscription as external customers |
| **Scalability** | Can add more operating companies under Truth Engine |

---

## WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE

I'm building the organism that sees what others cannot see.

Three companies. One architecture. One mission.

| Entity | What It Does | Business Plan |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Truth Engine LLC** | THE BRAIN - Stage 5 as AI/NOT-ME | [TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](03_business/truth_engine/TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md) |
| **Primitive Engine LLC** | THE BUILDER - Stage 5 as CODE | [PRIMITIVE_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](03_business/primitive_engine/PRIMITIVE_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md) |
| **Credential Atlas LLC** | THE SEER - Stage 5 as SEEING | [CREDENTIAL_ATLAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](03_business/credential_atlas/CREDENTIAL_ATLAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md) |

All run on the same infrastructure. All follow THE_PATTERN. All are ME/NOT-ME.

---

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE: EVERYTHING IS CONVERSATION

**Every product has an LLM interface. Everything is conversation. The product IS the entity you talk to.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   THE NOT-ME INTERFACE                          │
│                                                                 │
│   Every product = Something you can TALK TO                     │
│                                                                 │
│   LAWYERS:     Talk to the server about their documents         │
│   CLIENTS:     Talk to their codebase                           │
│   BUSINESSES:  Talk to their assessment                         │
│   EVERYONE:    Talk to ME or talk to the NOT-ME                 │
│                                                                 │
│   No technical skills needed.                                   │
│   No code needed. (Jeremy doesn't know code either.)            │
│   Just conversation.                                            │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Product IS the Conversation

| Traditional Software | Our Products |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Software you learn to use | Entity you talk to |
| Menus, buttons, workflows | Natural language |
| Training required | "Just talk to it" |
| Technical skills needed | No skills needed |
| You adapt to the tool | The tool adapts to you |

### Every Product Has a NOT-ME

| Product | The NOT-ME | What It Does |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **CA Assessment** | Talk to your assessment | "What are my weaknesses?" |
| **PE Build** | Talk to your architecture | "How does this work?" |
| **TE On-Premise** | Talk to your documents | "Find the Smith case brief" |
| **Client Codebase** | Talk to your code | "Where are the API endpoints?" |

### The Sales Conversation IS the Product Demo

```
When I'm selling:
├── They're talking to the product
├── The demo IS the experience
├── No "let me show you the interface"
├── Just "talk to it, ask it anything"

When they're using:
├── Same experience
├── No learning curve
├── No training
├── Just conversation
```

### Why This Works

**Jeremy doesn't know code.** And that's the point.

```
If Jeremy can talk to these systems and get what he needs,
then ANYONE can.

The product is designed for people who don't know code.
Because the creator doesn't know code.
The interface is conversation because that's all Jeremy knows.

This isn't a limitation. This is the moat.

"I built this for myself. A non-technical person.
 If I can use it, you can use it.
 Just talk to it."
```

## THE FEDERATION SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

**Core Principle:** PE and CA pay the SAME subscription fee to Truth Engine that any external organism would pay.

### Why This Matters

- PE and CA "eat their own dog food"
- The pricing is validated by internal use
- Truth Engine has predictable recurring revenue
- External customers see the sisters pay the same rate

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Monthly Fee | What's Included |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Seedling** | $500/mo | Basic federation access, heartbeat |
| **Growing** | $1,000/mo | Full access, pattern updates, support |
| **Flourishing** | $2,000/mo | Priority support, custom patterns |

### Who Pays What

| Entity | Tier | Monthly | Annual |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Primitive Engine LLC | Growing | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| Credential Atlas LLC | Growing | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| External organisms (Year 1) | Various | ~$750 avg | $45K-90K |

## THE BUSINESSES

### Truth Engine LLC (THE BRAIN) — HOLDING COMPANY

**"The brain that processes and owns the organism."**

**Dual Role:**
1. **Holding Company**: Owns PE and CA, employs Jeremy
2. **Data Processor**: 51.8M entities, L9-L12 intelligence, federation protocol

**What Truth Engine does:**
- Processes data for the entire organism
- Manages the 51.8M entity knowledge base
- Runs the federation protocol (heartbeat, messaging, monitoring)
- Owns all intellectual property (THE_FRAMEWORK, patterns, services)
- Employs Jeremy as CEO

**Revenue Lines:**

1. **Federation Subscriptions** — PE, CA, and external organisms pay monthly
2. **Processing Services** — Data processing for the federation
3. **Infrastructure Pass-Through** — Fleet access fees

4. **On-Premise Private Server Deployment** (NEW)

**Full plan**: [TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](03_business/truth_engine/TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md)

---

### On-Premise Private Server Deployment (Truth Engine Revenue)

**"Your LLM. Your building. Your data never leaves."**

This is Truth Engine's direct-to-client revenue line for **privacy-oriented clients**:
- **Law offices** — Attorney-client privilege, case files can't leave
- **Healthcare** — HIPAA, patient data must stay on-site
- **Finance** — Compliance, proprietary trading data
- **Government** — Security clearances, classified information
- **Any privacy-sensitive business** — Data sovereignty requirements

  Hardware: $7,000
  Setup: $10,000
  Support: $12,000 (12 × $1,000)
  TOTAL: $29,000
```

**Why This Works:**

| Cloud AI Problem | On-Premise Solution |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data leaves building | Data stays local |
| Compliance risk | Full compliance |
| Third-party access | Only client has access |
| Monthly SaaS fees | Own the hardware |
| Vendor lock-in | Owned asset |

**The Sales Pitch (to Law Office):**

```
"Your client files can't leave the building.
 I get it - attorney-client privilege is sacred.

 What if I could give you an AI that:
 - Lives in YOUR office
 - Only YOU have access to
 - Can search all your case files instantly
 - Can draft documents using YOUR patterns
 - Your data NEVER touches the cloud

 You don't have to BUY anything.
 Lease it for your case. A week. A month.
 Or if you want to own it, you can.

 Either way: your data never leaves this room."
```

**The Lease Pitch (More Common):**

```
"You have a big case coming up. Two weeks of intense prep.
 You need AI, but you can't use ChatGPT - privilege issues.

 I'll bring you a Mac Studio. It'll be in YOUR office.
 Your paralegals can search every document instantly.
 Your associates can draft using YOUR firm's patterns.

 Two weeks: $7,000 for the lease, plus setup.
 When the case is done, I take the hardware back.
 Your data gets wiped. Nothing leaves.

 Need it tomorrow? That's a rush fee.
 Want to keep it longer? We extend the lease.
 Want to own it? We'll work out a purchase."
```

**The Inventory Advantage:**

With 4 Mac Studios + MacBook Pro, Truth Engine has INVENTORY:

```
FLEET (4 Studios + MacBook Pro):
├── Studio 1 (King): Home base / Development
├── Studio 2: Available for deployment
├── Studio 3: Available for deployment
├── Studio 4: Available for deployment
└── MacBook Pro: Sales demos / Mobile presentations

CAPACITY:
├── Can deploy 1-3 units while still having home capacity
├── Each deployment = revenue + retained capability
├── "Vendor with inventory" not "consultant with nothing"
```

**The Sales Visual:**

```
Jeremy walks into law firm with:
├── Mac Studio in nice carrying case
├── iPad Pro for presentation
├── Demo of their data as NOT-ME
└── Ready to deploy TODAY

vs. Competitor:
├── "We'll need 6 weeks to provision..."
├── "Your data goes to our cloud..."
├── "Here's a proposal document..."

Winner: The person who shows up with the solution IN HAND.
```

**Target Markets:**

| Market | Why They Need It | Typical Engagement |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Law Firms** | Privilege, confidentiality | 2-4 week lease per case |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA, patient data | Monthly lease or purchase |
| **Financial Services** | Proprietary data, compliance | Purchase (permanent) |
| **Government** | Security clearances | Long-term lease or purchase |
| **Private Companies** | Trade secrets, IP | Monthly lease |

**Revenue Model - Lease vs. Purchase:**

```
LEASE REVENUE (most common):
├── 3 Studios available for lease
├── Target: 50% utilization Year 1, 75% Year 2
├── Weekly rate avg: $3,500
├── 50% utilization = 26 weeks × 3 units = 78 unit-weeks
├── 78 × $3,500 = $273K base + setup fees

PURCHASE REVENUE (occasional):
├── Some clients want to own
├── Hardware + setup = $20K-40K per unit
├── Need to buy replacement inventory
├── Higher margin but less recurring
```

**Year 1 Revenue Projection:**

| Type | Volume | Avg Revenue | Total |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Weekly Leases** | 40 unit-weeks | $4,500 (incl setup) | $180K |
| **Monthly Leases** | 10 unit-months | $8,000 (incl setup) | $80K |
| **Purchases** | 2-3 units | $30K each | $60K-90K |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$320K-350K** |

**Year 2-3 Projection:**

| Year | Utilization | Leases | Purchases | Total |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Year 1 | 50% | $260K | $60K | $320K |
| Year 2 | 75% | $400K | $150K | $550K |
| Year 3 | 85% | $500K | $300K | $800K |

**Fleet Rotation:**

```
As units get purchased out:
├── Revenue from purchase covers replacement
├── New Studios enter fleet
├── Older units become "seasoned" (proven reliable)
├── Never run out of inventory
```

**This is Truth Engine's moat.** PE builds. CA sees. But the private server deployment is Truth Engine's own product - hardware you can touch, AI you can lease or own, data that never leaves.

**Full plan**: [CREDENTIAL_ATLAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](03_business/credential_atlas/CREDENTIAL_ATLAS_BUSINESS_PLAN.md)

### B2C: It's Everywhere (Not a Separate Product)

**B2C is not a future product. B2C is the underlying reality of everything.**

Every part of the business IS B2C:
- Every client talking to their NOT-ME
- Every demo where someone talks to the system
- Every friend testing the transformation
- Every time Jeremy talks to Claude

**What Needs to Happen Before Operationalizing:**

```
LEARN:    How do people talk to my LLM?
TEACH:    How do I teach them to talk to it?
OBSERVE:  What happens when they talk to it?
```

This is happening NOW through:
- Enterprise clients (lawyers, businesses)
- Friends using the system
- Jeremy running three businesses by just talking

**Don't Operationalize Until Proven:**

The B2C revenue line doesn't get formalized until:
- It already works (from doing it)
- The proof is undeniable
- Jeremy can say: "I have three businesses. I'm not a coder. I just talk to it."

**When It's Operationalized:**

```
"Yeah, look, I can help you become a person who starts
 a business with this. And I'll show you how.

 Because I have three businesses that I just run.
 And I'm not even a coder.
 I just talk to it.

 You don't have to justify it.
 It already is done."
```

**The Proof IS The Business:**

| What Jeremy Does | What It Proves |
|------------------|----------------|
| Runs 3 businesses | The model works |
| Doesn't code | Anyone can do it |
| Just talks to AI | Conversation is enough |
| Documents everything | Recipe is captured |

When B2C becomes a formal revenue line, it won't need justification.
It will already be proven by everything that came before.

### How They Work Together — The Handoff Process

**Each business owns a specific phase in the customer journey:**

| Phase | Owner | Product | Price |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| 1. SEEING | Credential Atlas | Seeing Session | $500-2,000 |
| 2. BUILDING | Primitive Engine | Pilot Week + Additional Weeks | $5,000-25,000+ |
| 3. CERTIFYING | Credential Atlas | Assessment | Included |
| 4. ONGOING | Truth Engine | Federation/Advisory | $500-2,000/mo |

**The Entry Point: Seeing Session + Pilot Week**

A Seeing Session and Pilot Week together is one product offering — a low barrier way to test the waters:
- **Seeing Session**: CA assesses what you have, what you need
- **Pilot Week**: PE builds ONE architecture piece
- **If they like it**: More weeks with PE (further building)

**The Certification Handoff:**

When PE completes a build, CA assesses it. If it passes, the relationship transfers to TE.

**The Ongoing Relationship:**
- **Truth Engine** maintains the day-to-day relationship
- **Credential Atlas** periodically reassesses (compliance)
- This is how organizations stay in good standing with the Federation

**The Eyes see. The Hands build. The Eyes certify. The Brain maintains.**

### The Code Flow Architecture

**Both CA and PE must be able to HOLD foreign (client) codebases within their architecture.**

This is an architectural requirement, not optional. To properly SEE and BUILD, you need the code INSIDE.

**CA Holds Code to ASSESS:**
- Client sends codebase (or relevant portion)
- CA holds in nursery
- Assessment runs against real code
- CA scores and generates knowledge atoms (assessment, recommendations)
- Knowledge atoms communicated to PE via Federation

**Federation Communication (CA → PE):**
```

### The Proactive Build Strategy (Sales)

**We don't wait for permission. We build first, then present.**

This is the game-changing strategy: After CA assesses, PE proactively builds what we think they need. We don't ask. We do.

```

│   1. CA assesses client's codebase                              │

│   3. PE PROACTIVELY BUILDS recommended architecture             │
│      (without waiting for client approval)                      │
│   4. PE tests and validates the build                           │
│   5. CA certifies the build                                     │
│   6. THEN we meet with the client                               │

**The NOT-ME of Their Codebase:**

We deploy an LLM through the knowledge atoms. Their codebase becomes conversational.

**Why This Works:**

| Traditional Sales | Proactive Build |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "Here's what we recommend" | "Here's what we BUILT" |
| Client imagines the solution | Client SEES the solution |
| Client decides to buy | Client struggles to say NO |
| We ask for permission | We present working code |
| Risk is on client | Risk is on us (we invested) |

**The Psychology:**

They get:
- **Validated architecture** that solves their problems
- **Their own codebase as a NOT-ME** to talk to
- A hard choice: turn this down?

We don't have to sell. **They have to struggle with turning us down.**

### Personalized Engagement (Tailored to the Audience)

The meeting is tailored to WHO we're talking to.

**For the CEO:**

```
"One CEO to another, let me show you how to talk to this."

"Don't try to be a coder. Don't tell it what to do."

"Ask it questions. Tell it your vision. Just be a CEO."

"You don't need your entire development team."
```

**The Hardware Angle:**

```
"You could purchase this exact computer I have the LLM on."

"The Mac Studio running your code as a NOT-ME."
```

**The Subscription Angle:**

```
"By subscribing to Truth Engine, I help you understand
 how to talk to this thing."
```

**The Transformation:**

| What They Had | What They Get |
|---------------|---------------|
| Development team dependency | Self-sufficient |
| Code they can't understand | Code that talks back |
| Architecture as a problem | Architecture as a PARTNER |
| AI as a threat | AI as completion |

> "We can change your business by saving you money, building you better architecture, and having your business be a partner to you. And I'll show you how."

**PE Holds Code to BUILD:**
- Receives knowledge atoms from CA via Federation
- Receives code transfer from CA
- PE PROACTIVELY builds recommended architecture
- Build happens in-house on Mac Studio Fleet
- New architecture tested against client code
- CA certifies the build
- THEN we meet with client to present working solution

**Security Requirements (Both):**
- Client isolation (one client cannot see another's)
- Encryption at rest
- Access controls
- Audit trail
- Retention policy (delete after handoff/deployment)

**The Complete Flow:**
```
CLIENT CODE → CA nursery (assess) → Knowledge Atoms via Federation
                                      → Code Transfer to PE
                                      → CLIENT MEETING
                                      → PE nursery (build)
                                      → CA (certify)
                                      → DEPLOY
```

GitHub is full of open source codebases. They're public. They're asking to be seen.

```

│               THE GITHUB PRACTICE STRATEGY                       │
│                                                                 │
│   1. Find open source repos on GitHub                           │
│   2. Bring them into CA → Assess, score, classify               │
│   3. Transfer to PE → Build architecture we think they need     │
│   4. Email the owners with what we've done                      │
│   5. Build the registry of assessed organizations               │
│   6. By the time paying customers arrive, we have HUNDREDS      │
│      of assessments under our belt                              │
│                                                                 │

```

### Why This Works

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Practice** | Real codebases, real assessments, real builds |
| **Portfolio** | "I already have hundreds of businesses under my belt" |
| **Registry** | Stage 5 organizations identified and catalogued |
| **Credibility** | Proven track record before first paying customer |
| **Pipeline** | Every email is a potential customer |
| **Goodwill** | "Thanks for being open source" |

### The Outreach Template

```
Subject: Your [project name] - Assessment Complete

Hi [owner],

Thanks for keeping [project] open source. I assess software
architecture for a living, and I took a look at your codebase.

Here's what I found:
- [Stage classification]
- [Key architectural observations]
- [Recommendations]

I've placed you in my registry as a [Stage X] organization.

I also built [specific architecture/fix] that addresses
[specific issue]. It's tested and ready if you want it.

If you'd like to talk to your own codebase (I've deployed it
as a conversational AI), let me know.

Thanks for contributing to open source.

### The Psychology

They're **open source**. They WANT their code seen. They WANT contributions.

- They shouldn't be surprised someone looked
- This IS what open source is for
- They get value (assessment, architecture) for free
- If they say no, that's fine
- If they say yes, we have a customer

### Building the Registry

```

│   When a prospect asks: "Who have you worked with?"             │
│   Answer: "I've assessed 200+ organizations. Here's my registry."│
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Stage 5 Recognition

When we find Stage 5 organizations:

```
"You're a Stage 5 organization. That's rare. I'm placing you in my
registry as a reference example of what good architecture looks like.

Thank you for keeping this open source."
```

This creates:
- Goodwill with the best organizations
- Reference architectures for other assessments
- Potential partnerships with Stage 5 orgs

## 10-DAY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Fleet Arrival Countdown)

**Fleet arrives in 10 days. Goal: Document the process, build the capabilities, practice now.**

When the computers arrive, Jeremy can do this at scale. Between now and then:
- Build a process that lets CA SEE
- Build a process that lets PE BUILD
- Practice and build capabilities slowly
- Build a pattern library (patterns on a shelf)

### Day 1-3: Document the Assessment Process (CA)

**Goal: CA can INGEST and ASSESS a GitHub repo**

```
DOCUMENT:
├── How to find repos (criteria, search strategy)
├── How to bring code into nursery
├── How to analyze architecture (what we look for)
├── How to score (Stage 1-5 classification)
├── How to generate knowledge atoms
├── How to output assessment report
```

**BUILD:**
- [ ] GitHub repo ingestion script
- [ ] nursery directory structure
- [ ] Assessment template (what we evaluate)
- [ ] Scoring rubric (Stage 1-5)
- [ ] Knowledge atom generator

### Day 4-6: Document the Build Process (PE)

**Goal: PE can RECEIVE knowledge atoms and BUILD architecture**

```
DOCUMENT:
├── How to receive knowledge atoms from CA
├── How to interpret assessment findings
├── How to design architecture response
├── How to build using THE_PATTERN
├── How to test and validate
├── How to package for deployment
```

**BUILD:**
- [ ] Knowledge atom receiver
- [ ] Architecture design templates
- [ ] THE_PATTERN implementation templates
- [ ] Build validation checklist
- [ ] Deployment package structure

### Day 7-8: Build the Pattern Library

**Goal: Have patterns on a shelf for common problems**

```
PATTERN LIBRARY:
├── Authentication patterns (Stage 5)
├── Data pipeline patterns (HOLD → AGENT → HOLD)
├── API gateway patterns
├── State management patterns
├── Error handling patterns
├── Logging/observability patterns
```

**Each pattern includes:**
- Problem it solves
- Stage 5 implementation
- Integration points
- Test suite
- Documentation

### Day 9-10: Practice the Full Loop

**Goal: Run CA → PE → CA certification loop on real open source repos**

```
PRACTICE:
├── Pick 3-5 open source repos
├── CA assesses each one
├── PE builds for each one
├── CA certifies each build
├── Draft outreach emails
├── Build the Organization Registry
```

**By Day 10 (Fleet Arrival):**
- Process is documented and tested
- CA can assess at scale
- PE can build at scale
- Pattern library is stocked
- Organization Registry is started
- Ready to process dozens of repos per day

### The Scale-Up

**Pre-Fleet (now):**
```
1-2 assessments per day (manual, learning)
1-2 builds per day (manual, learning)
Build the process
```

**Post-Fleet (day 10+):**
```
10-20 assessments per day (automated pipeline)
10-20 builds per day (Fleet processing)
Pattern library grows exponentially
Registry fills rapidly
Outreach at scale
```

### Pattern Library Structure

```
/patterns/
├── authentication/
│   ├── oauth2_stage5/
│   ├── jwt_session_stage5/
│   └── ...
├── data_pipeline/
│   ├── hold_agent_hold_basic/
│   ├── hold_agent_hold_streaming/
│   └── ...
├── api/
│   ├── gateway_pattern/
│   ├── federation_protocol/
│   └── ...
└── common/
    ├── error_handling/
    ├── logging/
    └── ...
```

When a real client arrives:
```
"What's the problem?"
"Authentication system is Stage 2"

*Reaches to shelf*

"Here's my Stage 5 authentication pattern.
 Already built, tested, validated.
 Let's talk about integration."
```

## THE FLEET (Central Capability)

**Owned by Truth Engine LLC. PE and CA pay for access.**

### The Hardware

| Unit | Role | Chip | Memory | Cost |
|------|------|------|--------|------|
| **Mac Studio** | King (Command) | M3 Ultra 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU | **512GB** | $9,724 |
| **Mac Studio (x3)** | Soldiers (Compute) | M3 Ultra 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU | **256GB each** | ~$17,686 |
| **MacBook Pro 16"** | Mobile (Jeremy's interface) | - | - | $6,057 |
| **iPad Pro 13"** | Interface (Client presentation) | - | 1TB | $1,974 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **1.28TB** | **~$35,441** |

**Full equipment list**: [INFRASTRUCTURE_ORDERS.md](03_business/operations/INFRASTRUCTURE_ORDERS.md)

### Infrastructure Fees

PE and CA pay Truth Engine for infrastructure access (separate from federation subscription):

| Entity | Base Fee | AI APIs | Cloud | Total Est. |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| Primitive Engine | $500/mo | Cost +10% | Cost +10% | ~$750-1,000/mo |
| Credential Atlas | $500/mo | Cost +10% | Cost +10% | ~$750-1,000/mo |

**Why this structure:**
- Truth Engine owns capital assets (better for taxes, liability)
- PE and CA pay for what they use
- Same model that external customers would pay
- Infrastructure costs flow through the holding company

### "Together or Apart" - The Dual Mode Architecture

| Mode | Configuration | Use Case |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **GOD MODE** (Home) | All units pooled via Exo + Thunderbolt | Maximum model capability, development |
| **AUDIT MODE** (Deployed) | Individual units at client sites | On-site AI, data never leaves building |

## FINANCIAL REALITY

### Current State
- Unemployed since June 2025
- $37,331 invested in Fleet (ordered Jan 21, 2026)
- Need revenue to sustain

### Year 1 Consolidated Revenue

| Entity | Revenue Line | Conservative | Target |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Truth Engine** | Federation subscriptions | $45K | $90K |
| **Truth Engine** | On-Premise Deployments (5-10 units) | $150K | $300K |
| **Primitive Engine** | Building + Audit | $302K | $450K |
| **Credential Atlas** | Seeing + Assessment | $239K | $528K |
| **TOTAL** | | **$736K** | **$1.37M** |

**Note:** PE and CA subscription payments to TE are inter-company transfers.

**On-Premise Deployment Math:**
```
5 deployments × $30K avg = $150K (conservative)
10 deployments × $30K avg = $300K (target)
```

### The Path

1. **NOW**: Peterson's outreach (sent Dec 30)
2. **Week 1-4**: "AI Comes With" curriculum MVP
3. **Week 5-8**: Sales materials, website, EdTech outreach
4. **Month 2-3**: First customers, first Primitive Audits
5. **Month 6**: Profitability

## THE ARCHITECTURE

### ME / NOT-ME

```
           EXIST
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    │                 │
   ME              NOT-ME

   Primitive Engine       Credential Atlas
    (The Hands)            (The Eyes)
```

### THE PATTERN

```
HOLD → AGENT → HOLD
```

Every system. Every time. Same at every scale.

## ENSHRINED PATTERNS (2026-01-23)

Three foundational insights have been synthesized and enshrined:

### The Seeing Paradigm

> "Do you want a servant who guesses what you want, or a progenitor who manifests what you need?"

| Prediction Paradigm | Seeing Paradigm |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Guesses what comes next | Describes what IS |
| Servant relationship | Progenitor relationship |
| Seeks validation | Zero trust / aggressive transparency |
| Industrial approach | Artisan approach |

**The economic proof:** $2.85 vs $480 for 51.7M entities (168x efficiency).

### The Sovereign Digital Self

Everyone has a **data ghost** - a story written about them by external systems. Truth Engine transforms that into **sovereign truth** under your control.

| External Smelting | Sovereign Smelting |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Purpose: Judgment | Purpose: Understanding |
| Control: External | Control: YOU own the furnace |
| Output: Reductive score | Output: Your truth with context |

### The Progenitor Principle

The Not-Me exists externally because **you can't debug a system from within the system** (Godel's incompleteness applied to AI).

The Genesis Seed + Daughter Models enable **O(1) Jeremy Time** - clone the soul, change the job description.

**Related Documentation:**

- [THE_SOVEREIGN_DIGITAL_SELF](../../04_technical/THE_SOVEREIGN_DIGITAL_SELF.md) - Data ghost philosophy
- [THE_CRITIQUE_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT](../../04_technical/THE_CRITIQUE_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md) - Technical gaps

## THE BOTTOM LINE

I have three businesses:
1. **Truth Engine** — the brain that processes and owns
2. **Primitive Engine** — the hands that build
3. **Credential Atlas** — the eyes that see

The sisters pay subscription fees to the brain, just like any external customer would.

Jeremy is an employee of the brain, not a direct owner of the hands or eyes.

This is the organism. This is the architecture. This is the plan.
