# National Data Standards Positioning
## Jeremy Serna - IPEDS/CDS/CTDL National Standards Expert

**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Updated**: 2025-10-22 (Added CTDL/Credential Transparency expertise)
**Purpose**: Position Jeremy as national data standards expert, not "data operations manager"
**Target**: Companies using IPEDS, Common Data Set, CTDL credentialing standards

---

## The Actual Credentials

### Common Data Set Committee Member
- **One of THREE publishers** managing the CDS initiative:
  1. College Board
  2. U.S. News & World Report
  3. **Petersons** (Jeremy)

**What this means**: Jeremy was a decision-maker in defining national standards for college data collection

---

### Association of Institutional Research (AIR) Speaker
**Direct quote from Jeremy**: "I went to the Association of Institutional Research Conferences every year and spoke to all the colleges and universities in the country about their data collection and the government standards."

**What this means**:
- Jeremy trained institutional researchers nationwide on IPEDS/CDS standards
- Jeremy represented Petersons as the authoritative voice on data collection
- Universities across the US know Jeremy's work

---

### CTDL (Credential Transparency Description Language) Expert
**Evidence**:
1. **Built the entire Petersons Credentials Database (2019-2024)**:
   - **87,826 credentials** across 31 credential types (badges, certificates, degrees, licenses, micro-credentials)
   - **4,554 organizations** (colleges, certification bodies, professional associations, government agencies)
   - **7,439 learning opportunities** linked to credentials
   - **6,419 assessments** for credential attainment
   - **CIP code taxonomy integration** (NCES Classification of Instructional Programs)
   - **Cost data** for credentials, learning opportunities, assessments
   - **Relationship mapping** between organizations, credentials, learning opportunities, and assessments

2. **Modeled personal ontology after CTDL Handbook** (Sept 30, 2025)
   - Reference: https://credreg.net/ctdl/handbook
   - Used CTDL structure for personal concept taxonomy

**What this means**:
- Jeremy built a CTDL-like system BEFORE Credential Engine formalized it
- The Petersons Credentials Database predates widespread CTDL adoption (FL, CT states joined later)
- Jeremy understands credential taxonomy at massive scale (87K+ credentials)
- Jeremy knows the data challenges: organization types, credential hierarchies, learning pathway mapping

**Why this matters NOW**:
- States publishing 10,000+ credentials to Credential Registry using CTDL
- EdTech platforms integrating workforce skills data
- AI-powered career planning needs structured credential data
- **Jeremy already solved this problem at Petersons with 87,826 credentials**
- Jeremy bridges institutional data (IPEDS/CDS) AND workforce credentials (CTDL)

---

### Petersons Licensed Data Set Product Manager (2019-2024)
**Data products Jeremy managed**:
- IPEDS integration
- Common Data Set crosschecks
- Institutional data (Undergraduate, Graduate, Distance Learning, Scholarship)
- Credentials Database (87,826 credentials, 4,554 organizations)
- Multi-tier QA (crosscheck system, editorial notes, version control)

**Business impact** (verified by Mo Lam, June 26, 2025):
- Grew team from 6 to 19 people (217% team growth)
- Expanded data offering (launched credentials dataset)
- Grew business revenue by more than 100% during tenure

**Customers who licensed Jeremy's data**:
- Encoura (college admissions research)
- Xello (career/college planning)
- Empowerly (admissions platform)
- Partnership for LA Schools (charter support)
- TICAS, Ithaka S+R (research orgs)

## The Positioning

### NOT: "Data Operations Manager at Petersons"

### ACTUALLY: "National Data Standards Expert - IPEDS/CDS Committee Member, AIR Speaker, Petersons Data Product Leader"

---

## The Outreach Hook (By Company Type)

### For CRM/Enrollment Platforms (Slate, Element451, Salesforce)

> "I was on the Common Data Set Committee with U.S. News and College Board. I spoke at AIR conferences training institutional researchers on government data standards.
>
> Your platform integrates IPEDS/CDS data. I DEFINED those standards. I built multi-tier verification systems at Petersons (crosschecks, editorial review, provenance tracking).
>
> Now I've built the same architecture for my own life - the Truth Engine. Multi-tier confidence, queryable provenance, 240K+ data points.
>
> I can build truth infrastructure for your platform. Let me show you."

---

### For Analytics Platforms (HelioCampus, EAB, Encoura)

> "You licensed Petersons data that I delivered (2019-2024). You saw the product evolve from Access databases to CSV/Excel, from annual dumps to continuous delivery, from raw data to crosschecked+notes versions.
>
> I was on the CDS Committee. I spoke at AIR conferences. I trained universities on IPEDS standards.
>
> I built the same multi-tier truth architecture for my own AI conversations: Ground truth, derived truth with provenance, hypotheses flagged as uncertain.
>
> I understand research-grade data requirements. I can architect it for your analytics platform."

---

### For College Search Platforms (Xello, CollegeVine, Common App)

> "I managed the national data standards your platform depends on:
> - Common Data Set Committee member (with U.S. News, College Board)
> - AIR conference speaker (trained institutional researchers nationwide)
> - Petersons data product leader (delivered to Encoura, Xello, Empowerly)
>
> Your users need to trust the data. I built verification infrastructure at Petersons. I can build it for your platform."

---

### For U.S. News, College Board (CDS Partners)

> "We worked together on the Common Data Set Committee. I represented Petersons.
>
> You've seen AI hallucinations in rankings data. You've seen institutional data quality issues. You need multi-tier verification.
>
> I built that at Petersons (CDS crosschecks, editorial review). Then I built it for my own life (Truth Engine - 240K+ data points with provenance tracking).
>
> Let me show you what organizational epistemology looks like when you build it from the ground up."

---

### For Credential/Workforce Platforms (Credential Engine, Credly, Parchment, IMS Global)

> "I built the Petersons Credentials Database (2019-2024):
> - 87,826 credentials across 31 credential types (badges, certificates, degrees, licenses, micro-credentials)
> - 4,554 organizations (colleges, certification bodies, professional associations)
> - 7,439 learning opportunities, 6,419 assessments
> - Full CIP code taxonomy integration
>
> This was before CTDL became widely adopted. I solved credential interoperability at scale when states were still figuring out how to publish their first 10,000 credentials.
>
> Your platform needs:
> - Credential taxonomy at scale (I've handled 87K+)
> - Organization type mapping (I've classified 4,554)
> - Learning pathway integration (I've linked 7,439 opportunities)
> - Data quality verification (I built multi-tier QA at Petersons)
>
> I can build credentialing infrastructure that bridges institutional data (IPEDS/CDS) and workforce credentials (CTDL). Let me show you."

## The Demonstration (Adapted for IPEDS/CDS Context)

**Opening**:
> "I was one of three publishers managing the Common Data Set - alongside U.S. News and College Board. I spoke at AIR conferences training institutional researchers on government data standards.
>
> For 5 years, I delivered IPEDS/CDS data products to companies like Encoura, Xello, Empowerly. I built multi-tier verification: raw institutional data, crosschecks, editorial review.
>
> Then I applied the same architecture to my own life."

**Live Demo**: [Opens BigQuery]
```sql
-- Show multi-tier truth architecture
SELECT
  tier,
  confidence_level,
  COUNT(*) as data_points
FROM (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN source = 'sms' AND verified = true THEN 'Tier 1: Ground Truth'
      WHEN source = 'ai' AND v_cmp IS NOT NULL THEN 'Tier 2: Derived Truth'
      ELSE 'Tier 3: Hypothesis'
    END as tier,
    CASE
      WHEN source = 'sms' THEN 1.0
      WHEN v_cmp >= 0.9 THEN 0.95
      WHEN v_cmp >= 0.7 THEN 0.85
      ELSE 0.70
    END as confidence_level
  FROM source_data.ai_conversations_enriched
)
GROUP BY tier, confidence_level
```

**Explanation**:
> "This is the same architecture I built at Petersons:
> - Tier 1: Verified institutional data (like CDS submissions)
> - Tier 2: Crosschecked data (like Petersons verification layer)
> - Tier 3: Editorial notes (human review)
>
> But now it's for 240,000 data points about my own life. Queryable. Auditable. With provenance."

**The Bridge**:
> "Your platform needs the same thing:
> - IPEDS data (Tier 1)
> - Your enrichment/analytics (Tier 2)
> - User-generated content/AI outputs (Tier 3)
>
> I can build truth infrastructure that makes confidence levels explicit, not hidden."
