# Business Plan Evaluation Methodology

**Evaluator Role**: Independent reviewer (no prior involvement in plan creation)
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: Ready for framework input

---

## My Position

I'm approaching these business plans as an outside evaluator. I didn't build them, I don't have emotional investment in them, and my job is to apply your framework objectively and tell you what I see.

---

## What I Need From You

1. **The Framework** - The evaluation criteria/lens you want me to use
2. **The Business Plans** - The plans to evaluate (files, documents, or descriptions)

---

## How I'll Approach This

### Step 1: Understand the Framework
- Read your framework completely before looking at any plans
- Identify the key dimensions it evaluates
- Note any scoring criteria, thresholds, or decision rules
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous

### Step 2: Review Each Plan Independently
- Read each plan without comparing to others first
- Take notes on strengths, weaknesses, gaps
- Identify what's present vs. what's missing
- Flag assumptions and risks

### Step 3: Apply the Framework
- Map each plan against framework criteria systematically
- Score or rate where the framework calls for it
- Document evidence for each assessment
- Note where the plan is silent on framework requirements

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings
- Summarize each plan's alignment with the framework
- Identify patterns across plans (if multiple)
- Rank or prioritize if that's what you need
- Provide clear recommendations

## What My Output Will Look Like

For each plan evaluated:

| Section | What It Contains |
|---------|------------------|
| **Executive Summary** | 2-3 sentences on overall assessment |
| **Framework Alignment** | How well it maps to each framework dimension |
| **Strengths** | What the plan does well |
| **Gaps** | What's missing or weak |
| **Risks** | What could go wrong |
| **Recommendation** | My verdict and reasoning |

---

## What I Won't Do

- Advocate for any particular plan (I'm evaluating, not selling)
- Fill in gaps with assumptions (I'll flag what's missing)
- Soften findings to be nice (you want honest assessment)
- Overcomplicate the analysis (I'll be direct)

---

## Ready When You Are

Send me:
1. The framework
2. The plan(s) to evaluate

I'll apply the framework and give you my honest assessment.
