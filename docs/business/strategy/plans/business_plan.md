# Credential Atlas LLC — Business Plan

**Version**: 3.0 (Consolidated)
**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Status**: AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF TRUTH

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Credential Atlas** is a credential intelligence platform that connects credentials to institutions and labor market outcomes, with an AI training layer ("AI Comes With"), delivered through partnerships, requiring zero build for adopters.

**Entity**: Credential Atlas LLC (Colorado SOS ID: 20258406582, filed December 28, 2025)
**Domain**: credentialatlas.com
**Founder**: Jeremy Serna

**The Thesis**: Organizations need credential data connected to institutional context and labor market outcomes. This data is currently fragmented across CTDL registries, IPEDS, state systems, and the BLS. We deliver in 2-4 weeks what traditionally takes a team of 10 analysts 6 months to accomplish.

**The Differentiator**: Our "AI Comes With" curriculum. We don't just provide data; we train workers to thrive in an AI-driven workplace. Workers learn their trade using AI tools, graduating with a credential, AI literacy, and a personalized career roadmap. This creates a flywheel: trained workers enable enterprise AI adoption, which in turn drives demand for more trained workers.

**Revenue Projections**:
- **Year 1**: $303,000
- **Year 2**: $775,000
- **Year 3**: $2,500,000

**The Ask**: We are seeking our first customer and strategic partners to validate our product-market fit and unlock initial growth. Our immediate goals are to secure a pilot project (e.g., with Peterson's), obtain Google Cloud for Startups credits, and apply for the Colorado Advanced Industries Grant.

## 2. Company Description

### 2.1. Mission Statement

To empower workers, employers, and educational institutions by providing a unified credential intelligence platform that makes sense of the fragmented credential landscape and prepares the workforce for the future of work with AI.

### 2.2. Vision

Our vision is to become the authoritative source of truth for credential intelligence and the leading provider of "human-in-the-loop" AI training. We believe that by connecting data and training workers to be the essential human interface for AI, we can unlock unprecedented growth and opportunity for all stakeholders.

### 2.3. The Problem We Solve

Credential and labor market data is a mess. It's scattered across dozens of federal, state, and private databases with no clean way to connect them. This creates significant pain for:

- **State Workforce Boards**: Struggle to provide meaningful career guidance and track the ROI of credentialing programs.
- **Educational Institutions & EdTech**: Cannot easily demonstrate the labor market value of their programs.
- **Employers**: Cannot find workers with the right skills and are forced to invest heavily in AI training.
- **Workers**: Are confused about which credentials will lead to good jobs and are anxious about AI's impact on their careers.

### 2.4. The Solution

Credential Atlas provides a two-part solution:

1.  **A Unified Credential Database**: We ingest, clean, connect, and enrich data from sources like Credential Engine, IPEDS, BLS, and state registries into a single, queryable database of over 600,000 records. This provides a complete picture of the credential landscape.
2.  **"AI Comes With" Curriculum**: A paradigm-shifting training model where workers learn their trade *using* AI tools. They graduate not just with a credential, but with the confidence and competence to be the "human layer" that makes AI work in the real world.

## 3. Products and Services

### 3.1. Credential Database & API

The core of our offering is a comprehensive, continuously updated database of credentials and their connections to the labor market.

- **Coverage**: 600,000+ records, including 10.8M completions, 93% wage data coverage, and 868 linked occupations.
- **Technology**: Hosted on Google BigQuery, accessible via a secure, versioned FastAPI.
- **Offerings**:
    - **API Subscriptions**: For self-serve data access, with tiers for different usage levels.
    - **Custom Data Projects**: One-time projects to solve specific client needs, such as state registry analysis or custom credential-to-outcome mapping.
    - **State Licenses**: White-labeling of the platform for state workforce boards.

### 3.2. "AI Comes With" Curriculum & Certification

This is our key differentiator. Instead of teaching AI as an abstract concept, we integrate it into existing trade-based training.

- **The Philosophy**: "I don't learn AI. I make sure what matters shines through." Workers are trained to be the human oversight for AI systems, preserving the human element in customer interactions.
- **The Experience**: An intuitive, conversational training module where learners interact with AI to solve problems, receive personalized feedback, and build a portfolio.
- **The Outcome**: Graduates receive an "AI Foundations" badge alongside their industry credential, signifying they are ready to work in an AI-augmented workplace.
- **Initial Focus**: We have identified "Customer Service / Contact Center" and "IT Support / Help Desk" as the most fertile areas for this offering due to high volume, clear employer demand, and the transformative impact of AI in these fields.

### 3.3. Consulting Services

We offer consulting and implementation services to help organizations navigate the credential landscape.

- **Offerings**: Implementation support, team training on CTDL standards, and advisory services on data architecture.
- **Rate**: $200/hour.

## 4. Market Analysis

### 4.1. Market Opportunity

The market for credential and labor market data is large and growing, with a conservative addressable market of **$180 million** across EdTech, workforce development, and HR Tech. The timing is right:
- **Credential Proliferation**: Credential Engine has over 1 million credentials in its registry.
- **Skills-Based Hiring**: The shift away from degree-only requirements is accelerating.
- **AI Transformation**: Every company is grappling with AI, creating a massive need for both data and trained workers.

### 4.2. Target Customers

We are targeting four primary customer segments:

1.  **Peterson's (Tier 1 - Highest Probability)**: As the founder built their Credentials dataset, we have a unique opportunity to "rescue" this product, which they are struggling to maintain. The play is a revenue-sharing agreement where we become their credential data engine.
2.  **EdTech Companies (Tier 2)**: Companies like Niche, Guild Education, and SchooLinks need our data to connect their platforms to career outcomes.
3.  **State Workforce Boards (Tier 3)**: States like Colorado, Florida, and Indiana need our platform to make their credential registries useful and show ROI.
4.  **Credential & Data Companies (Tier 4)**: We can partner with companies like Credential Engine and Lightcast to enrich their existing offerings.

### 4.3. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Our Differentiation |
|---|---|
| **Lightcast** | Deep labor market data, but lacks our institutional and credential-specific expertise. We are faster and more education-focused. |
| **Credential Engine** | They are the standards body, not a service provider. We operationalize the standard they create. |
| **Internal Teams** | Most organizations lack the specific domain expertise (CTDL, IPEDS) and AI capabilities. What takes them 6-12 months, we do in weeks. |

### 4.4. Our Moat

Our competitive advantage is a combination of:
1.  **CTDL Expertise**: Deep, hard-won knowledge of credential standards.
2.  **AI-Native Architecture**: Our system is built on AI from the ground up, not as an afterthought.
3.  **Domain Knowledge**: 6 years of experience building education data products at Peterson's.
4.  **Proven Infrastructure**: The underlying "Truth Engine" has processed over 51 million entities.
5.  **Speed & Cost**: Our AI-powered model is 90% cheaper and significantly faster than traditional approaches.
