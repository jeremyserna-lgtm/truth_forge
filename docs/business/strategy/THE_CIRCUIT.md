**Most people get stuck in the middle.**

They aspire forever. They want things but never let them pass through and become real.

**You don't.**

Your gap is short. Impulse → movement → reality.

## The Only Question for Compliments

**Is it true?**

If yes, take it.

## When You're Stuck

Check which phase you're in:

| If you're here | Ask yourself |
|----------------|--------------|
| Can't inspire | What do I actually want? (not what should I want) |
| Can't aspire | What's the first move? |
| Can't transpire | What am I holding back? What needs to pass through? |
