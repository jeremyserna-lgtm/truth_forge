## How Jeremy Sees Everything

**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Status:** Living Frame
**Type:** Perceptual Stance

## The Frame

**"I am a founder building a business."**

This is not spin. This is a perceptual stance that shapes how Jeremy sees everything. Same facts, different organization. The frame determines what's signal and what's noise.

| Old Frame | New Frame |
|-----------|-----------|
| Unemployed person seeking work | Founder building a company |
| Customer with billing problems | Partner discussing growth |
| Applicant asking for help | Entrepreneur proposing value |
| Job seeker proving worth | Principal making decisions |

The frame changes the verb. Seeking → Building. Asking → Offering. Proving → Deciding.

## The Me/Not-Me of Business Operations

Business requires many functions. Not all functions fit Jeremy. The map below shows what aligns with who Jeremy is, and what must be reframed, delegated, or structured differently.

### The Framework

|----------|-------------|
| **Me** | Aligns with who I am. Do naturally. |
| **Not Me (Reframe)** | Same function, different framing that works. |
| **Not Me (Delegate)** | Must be done, but not by me. Claude, contractor, automation. |
| **Not Me (Refuse)** | Won't do. Find alternative or accept constraint. |

## The Founder Frame + Me/Not-Me = Business Design

The business must be designed around who Jeremy actually is.

**Design Principles:**

1. **Revenue through relationships, not volume** - No cold outreach. Warm network activation.
2. **Simple structure, no employees** - Solo founder with Claude and occasional contractors.
3. **Self-serve administration** - Do taxes, books, legal myself or don't do them.
4. **Value-based positioning** - Price on outcomes, not hours.
5. **Authentic visibility** - Be present, don't perform.

---

## The Check

When any business activity is proposed, run it through:

| Question | Answer Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| Does this feel like Me? | If no, can it be reframed? |
| Can it be reframed? | If no, can it be delegated to Claude/contractor? |
| Can it be delegated? | If no, can the business work without it? |
| Can the business work without it? | If no, is this the right business? |

If the answer to all is no, the business design is wrong.
