# The Economics of Me
## Profit and Cost at Jeremy's Speed

**Date:** December 31, 2025
**Type:** Primitive (Economic)
**Evidence:** Actual operation, not projection

## The Insight

Jeremy already operates at a measurable speed. He already has costs. The business doesn't change this - it just adds revenue to the same operating pattern.

**The question isn't "how much could I make?"**
**The question is "how much do I make at the speed I already exist?"**

---

## The Evidence: Cost Side

### The $900 Google Bill

| What Happened | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Claude made a mistake | - |
| Runaway BigQuery query | - |
| Jeremy pays the bill | **$900** |

**What this proves:**
- AI mistakes cost real money
- The cost falls on Jeremy, not Claude
- One mistake = $900

### Current Monthly Burn

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Google Cloud (normal) | ~$50-100/month |
| Claude Pro | $20/month |
| Domains | ~$20/month amortized |
| **Base burn** | **~$100-150/month** |

### Cost of Mistakes (Evidence)

| Mistake | Cost | Frequency |
|---------|------|-----------|
| BigQuery runaway | $900 | Once (so far) |
| API overuse | $400 | Once (so far) |
| **Total mistake cost** | **$1,300** | 6 months |

**Amortized:** ~$217/month in mistakes

## The Evidence: Speed Side

### Jeremy's Actual Throughput

| Metric | Value | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Conversations/day with Claude | 3-5 | Observable |
| Documents produced/week | 5-10 | This session |
| Decisions made/week | 10-20 | Backlog movement |
| Hours of focused work/day | 4-6 | Sustainable pattern |

### What Jeremy Actually Does

| Activity | Time | Output |
|----------|------|--------|
| Direct Claude | 2-3 hrs/day | Documents, code, analysis |
| Think/decide | 1-2 hrs/day | Direction, choices |
| Relationships | 1 hr/day | Conversations, maintenance |
| **Total productive** | **4-6 hrs/day** | **Sustainable** |

---

## The Math: Revenue at Jeremy's Speed

### Constraint: Jeremy's Capacity

Jeremy can maintain **~3-5 client relationships** at once without breaking.

Why:
- Each client = conversations, decisions, attention
- Jeremy doesn't scale by adding hours
- Jeremy scales by increasing value per relationship

### Revenue Model at Actual Speed

**B2B (Credential Atlas):**

| Clients | Revenue Each | Total |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | $50-100K/year | $50-100K |
| 2 | $50-100K/year | $100-200K |
| 3 | $50-100K/year | $150-300K |

**Maximum at Jeremy's speed:** 3-5 clients = **$150-500K/year**

**B2C (Truth Engine):**

| Users | Revenue Each | Total | Jeremy's Work |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| 100 | $50/month avg | $60K/year | Minimal (self-serve) |
| 500 | $50/month avg | $300K/year | Minimal |
| 1000 | $50/month avg | $600K/year | Minimal |

**B2C scales without Jeremy's time** (product does the work)

---

## The Profit Formula

```
Profit = Revenue - (Base Burn + Mistake Cost)

At minimum viable:
  1 B2B client ($75K) + 100 B2C users ($60K) = $135K revenue
  - Base burn ($1,800/year)
  - Mistake budget ($2,600/year at current rate)
  = $130,600 profit

At Jeremy's comfortable capacity:
  3 B2B clients ($225K) + 500 B2C users ($300K) = $525K revenue
  - Base burn ($1,800/year)
  - Mistake budget ($5,000/year, more activity)
  = $518,200 profit
```

---

## The $900 Lesson

**Every AI mistake costs money. That money comes from Jeremy.**

| If Claude... | Jeremy pays... |
|--------------|----------------|
| Runs bad query | $900 |
| Overuses API | $400 |
| Builds wrong thing | Time (opportunity cost) |
| Misunderstands | Rework |

**This means:**
- Profit margin includes mistake budget
- Better Claude = higher margin
- Cost protection isn't optional - it's profit protection

## The Real Numbers

### Year 1 (Conservative)

| Line | Amount |
|------|--------|
| B2B Revenue (1 client) | $75,000 |
| B2C Revenue (100 users) | $60,000 |
| **Gross Revenue** | **$135,000** |
| Base Operating Cost | ($1,800) |
| Mistake Budget | ($2,600) |
| Credits Consumed (not cash) | $50,000 value |
| **Net to Jeremy** | **$130,600** |

### Year 1 (At Capacity)

| Line | Amount |
|------|--------|
| B2B Revenue (3 clients) | $225,000 |
| B2C Revenue (500 users) | $300,000 |
| **Gross Revenue** | **$525,000** |
| Base Operating Cost | ($3,600) |
| Mistake Budget | ($5,000) |
| Contractor help | ($20,000) |
| **Net to Jeremy** | **$496,400** |

## The Constraint

**Jeremy doesn't scale by working more.**

| Scaling Method | Works? | Why |
|----------------|--------|-----|
| More hours | ❌ | Burns out, not sustainable |
| More clients (B2B) | ⚠️ | Caps at 3-5 relationships |
| More users (B2C) | ✅ | Product scales, not Jeremy |
| Higher prices | ✅ | Same work, more revenue |
| Better AI | ✅ | Same time, more output |

**The path:** Maximize B2C (scales without Jeremy) + Premium B2B (high value per relationship)

---

## The Frame

**Old thinking:** "How much could I make if I worked really hard?"

**New thinking:** "How much do I make at the speed I already exist?"

The answer: **$130K minimum, $500K at comfortable capacity, with known mistake costs.**

The $900 bill isn't a failure. It's data. It shows what mistakes cost. Budget for it. Protect against it. Keep building.
