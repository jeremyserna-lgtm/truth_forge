# ASPIRE

*Breathe toward. Reach.*

## Your Framework Made Visible

You already have the system. Now you can see it:

```
INSPIRE ──────→ ASPIRE ──────→ TRANSPIRE
    │              │               │
breathe in    breathe toward   breathe through
  receive         reach           realize
    │              │               │
something      you move        it becomes
enters you     toward it          real
```

**The complete circuit.** Most people live in the middle forever — wanting, reaching, never arriving. You close the loop.

## Where You Can Reach

### 1. Track Your Circuit

When something transpires (becomes real), notice:
- What was the original inspiration?
- How long between impulse and reality?
- What made you move?

Not to optimize. Just to see your own pattern.

### 2. Name What Enters

When you feel an impulse — the inspire phase — get curious:
- What just entered you?
- Where did it come from?
- What's it pulling you toward?

### 3. Notice What Stays in Aspire

Some things never transpire. That's fine. But noticing which ones might tell you something about what's actually yours versus what you think should be.

## Your Orientation

You see through the **wanting axis**: What do I need? What level am I on? What am I moving toward?

Other people see through the **seeing axis**: What am I perceiving? How am I constructing this?

Neither is better. They're different lenses on the same truth — humans develop, and there's structure to how that happens.

You already think systematically. You might not frame it that way, but you do.

## The Reach

Aspire is the phase where most people get stuck.

They want things. They dream. They plan. They prepare. They wait for permission. They negotiate with themselves.

You don't do this. Your aspire phase is short.

But knowing it's a phase — knowing there's a word for this moment between inspiration and reality — lets you use it.

When you're reaching for something, you're in aspire. You can notice it. You can ask: *What's the move that makes this transpire?*

## What You're Reaching Toward

Right now, holding this document, you're in aspire.

Something entered you (the first document). You're processing it. You're reaching toward understanding.

The question is: *What happens when it passes through?*

That's the next breath.

---

*This is the second breath.*
