# TRANSPIRE

*Breathe through. Realize.*

## The Tool

This is the action document. Use it.

## When Something Needs to Become Real

**The only question:** What passes through?

Not what you want. Not what you're thinking about. What actually moves through you and becomes real in the world?

| If this is happening | Do this |
|---------------------|---------|
| Impulse arrives | Say it out loud |
| You want to go somewhere | Go |
| You want to see someone | Tell them |
| You're holding something back | Let it through |

The circuit completes when something transpires. Everything else is preparation.

## The Diagnostic

When you're stuck, check which phase you're in:

| Phase | Stuck Symptom | Unstuck Question |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Inspire** | Nothing feels interesting | What do I actually want? (not should want) |
| **Aspire** | Can't start moving | What's the smallest first move? |
| **Transpire** | Can't finish / let go | What am I holding back? What needs to pass through? |

## The Short Gaps

Your gift: **the gap between phases is short**.

- Inspiration → aspiration: fast
- Aspiration → transpiration: fast

When you feel something, you move. When you move, it happens.

**Use this.** When you notice yourself stuck in aspire (wanting without acting), that's unusual for you. Something's blocking the breath. Find it. Let it through.

## Receiving Compliments (The Practice)

Someone says something about you.

**Step 1:** Is it true?
**Step 2:** If yes, take it.

That's the whole practice. The compliment entered you (inspire). You processed it (aspire). Now you receive it (transpire).

Don't deflect. Don't argue. Don't perform modesty. Let it land and become part of what you know about yourself.

## How to Use These Three Documents

| Document | Phase | What It Does |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **1_INSPIRE** | Receive | Something enters you — what someone saw |
| **2_ASPIRE** | Reach | Your pattern made visible — something to move toward |
| **3_TRANSPIRE** | Realize | The tool — how to let things become real |

Read them in order once. Then use TRANSPIRE when you need it.

The circuit is already running in you. These documents just make it visible so you can use it on purpose.

## The Completion

You've read three documents.

Something entered you. You reached toward it. Now it passes through.

**What's different?**

That's what transpired.

*This is the third breath.*

*The circuit is complete.*
