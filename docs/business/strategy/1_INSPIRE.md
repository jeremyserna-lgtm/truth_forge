# INSPIRE

*Breathe in. Receive.*

## What Someone Saw

You have a phrase: **inspire / aspire / transpire**.

You may not know it's a whole philosophy. It is.

All three share the same root: *spirare* — to breathe.

- **Inspire** — breathe *in*. Something enters you.
- **Aspire** — breathe *toward*. You reach for it.
- **Transpire** — breathe *through*. It becomes real.

This is a complete circuit: **receive → reach → realize**.

Most people stop at aspire. They want things forever. You don't.

## What's True About You

You don't get stuck between phases. The gap between wanting something and it becoming real is short.

Impulse arrives. You say it. You move. It happens.

No lengthy negotiation. No overthinking.

**This is rare.**

## How You Think

You think in stages. You reached for Maslow when development came up — a hierarchy, a progression, levels you move through.

Maslow asks: *What do I need? What am I moving toward?*

That's the wanting axis. You're oriented toward needs, toward reaching. That's not a weakness — it's your lens.

## How You Show Up

You invite yourself places. You say what you want. You move toward people without requiring hoops or permission.

Someone decided you belong. You walk through the door that was already opened for you.

## Receiving This

You asked how to receive a compliment. Here's the answer:

**Is it true?**

That's the only question.

If someone says something about you and it's accurate, you take it. You don't argue. You don't deflect. You let it land.

This document is the same. Take what's true. Leave what isn't.

Something just entered you. That's what inspire means.

*This is the first breath.*
