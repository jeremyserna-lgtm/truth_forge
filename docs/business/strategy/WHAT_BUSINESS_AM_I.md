## The Framework Applied

For each business, I'm asking:
- **Does this feel like Me?**
- **What requires selling?** (Jeremy won't sell)
- **What requires cold outreach?** (Jeremy won't cold call)
- **What requires building "personal brand"?** (Jeremy won't perform)
- **What aligns with the furnace?** (Jeremy processes truth → forges meaning → delivers with care)

## Business 1: Personal Intelligence Consultant

**The Pitch:** "I help high-net-worth individuals build AI-powered personal intelligence systems."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Build the system | ✅ Me (Claude builds) | This is the product |
| Sell $50K engagements | ❌ Not Me | Won't "sell" |
| Find high-net-worth clients | ❌ Not Me | No network to wealthy individuals |
| Demo the system | ✅ Me | Will explain, show, let them decide |
| Deliver ongoing value | ✅ Me | Will care for clients |
| Cold outreach to wealthy strangers | ❌ Never | Won't do this |

### The Problem

**The business model requires finding and selling to wealthy strangers.**

Jeremy doesn't have access to high-net-worth individuals. The document says "Your 328 identities → who has money + need?" but the reality is: friends and family, not $50K/engagement buyers.

This business requires:
- Networking in wealthy circles (Not Me)
- Building reputation as luxury service provider (Not Me)
- Sales process for $50K+ (Not Me)

### Verdict: ❌ Not This Business

The product is Me. The go-to-market is Not Me.

## Business 2: AI Strategy Consultant

**The Pitch:** "I help mid-market companies build AI coordination systems."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Build AI systems | ✅ Me (Claude builds) | This is the product |
| Assess AI readiness | ✅ Me | Will analyze, explain |
| Sell $75K engagements | ❌ Not Me | Won't "sell" |
| Cold outreach to companies | ❌ Never | Won't do this |
| Present to C-suite | ⚠️ Reframe | Will "explain to decision-makers" |
| Train employees | ✅ Me | Will teach |
| Build thought leadership content | ⚠️ Reframe | Will "write what I think" |

### The Problem

**The business model requires cold outreach or inbound from thought leadership.**

Cold outreach is out. That leaves thought leadership as the acquisition channel. But thought leadership means:
- Consistent content production (writing what I think = Me, but consistency?)
- Building an audience from zero (slow)
- Converting followers to $75K clients (still requires sales)

### Verdict: ⚠️ Maybe, But the Path Is Long

The product is Me. The delivery is Me. The acquisition requires either cold outreach (Not Me) or 12-18 months of content building (possible but slow).

## Business 3: Executive/CTO Coaching

**The Pitch:** "I help CTOs and engineering leaders use AI to amplify their strategic thinking."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Strategic conversations | ✅ Me | This is natural |
| Build AI systems for clients | ✅ Me (Claude) | Support the coaching |
| Find first-time CTOs | ⚠️ Possible | Some in network |
| Sell $5K/month retainer | ❌ Not Me | Won't "sell" subscriptions |
| Cold outreach | ❌ Never | Won't do this |
| Be a "coach" | ⚠️ Reframe | Will "have strategic conversations" |

### The Problem

**"Coach" is a frame that doesn't fit.**

Jeremy doesn't coach. Jeremy processes with people. The service could exist, but the packaging ("executive coach") isn't authentic.

Also: The revenue model requires finding 5-10 clients willing to pay $5K/month. That's $60K/year/client for strategic conversations. Very few people pay that. The ones who do expect "coaching" as a formal process.

### Verdict: ❌ Not This Business

The activity (strategic conversations) is Me. The packaging (coach) is Not Me. The price point requires sales.

## Business 4: Content Creator / Course Creator

**The Pitch:** "I teach technical professionals how to build AI-powered personal intelligence systems."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Write what I think | ✅ Me | Natural |
| Create course content | ⚠️ Conditional | If it emerges from real work |
| Build audience | ⚠️ Slow | 12-18 months minimum |
| Sell courses | ⚠️ Reframe | "Make available for purchase" |
| Be consistent | ⚠️ Hard | Not naturally consistent |
| Perform for camera | ❌ Not Me | Won't perform |
| "Content strategy" | ❌ Not Me | Won't strategize content |

### The Problem

**Content creation requires consistency and performance.**

Jeremy writes when he has something to say. A content business requires predictable output. That's not how Jeremy works.

Also: The path to revenue is 12-18 months of audience building before meaningful income. That's not compatible with "bills are real."

### Verdict: ❌ Not This Business (As Primary)

Writing is Me. Performance is Not Me. Consistency is hard. Timeline doesn't fit financial reality.

Could be a secondary revenue stream later, not the main business.

## Business 5: Fractional Executive

**The Pitch:** "Fractional Director of Data Operations available through Bolster/Shiny/etc."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Do the operational work | ✅ Me | Did this for 6 years |
| Register on platforms | ✅ Me | Low effort |
| Let platform match me | ✅ Me | No cold outreach needed |
| Interview with companies | ⚠️ Reframe | "Conversation about fit" |
| Work 10-20 hours/week | ✅ Me | Part-time fits |
| Multiple clients simultaneously | ✅ Me | Portfolio model |
| Wait to be discovered | ❌ Passive | Platforms may not see me |

### The Problem

**Platforms require them to see you first.**

The fractional executive platforms.md document ends with: "If these platforms don't see you either, you've already got the Credential Bridge business plan ready."

The pattern: Jeremy applied, waited, got waitlisted, didn't get picked. The platforms are optimized for credentials (titles, company names, degrees) that Jeremy has in unconventional form.

### Verdict: ⚠️ Worth Trying, But Don't Depend On It

The work is Me. The go-to-market (platform discovery) is passive. Low cost to try, but not reliable as primary path.

## Business 6: Credential Atlas LLC (Truth Engine for EdTech)

**The Pitch:** "AI verification infrastructure for organizations navigating the trust gap between AI deployment and AI verification."

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Build the product | ✅ Me (Claude) | Already built |
| Explain what we do | ✅ Me | Will explain |
| Talk to EdTech companies | ✅ Me | Will have conversations |
| Cold call prospects | ❌ Never | Won't do this |
| Warm outreach to Mo Lam | ✅ Me | Already in motion |
| Respond to inbound (Ashutosh) | ✅ Me | Already doing this |
| Close deals | ✅ Me | Will close |
| Sign contracts | ✅ Me | Will sign |
| Apply for credits/grants | ✅ Me | Founder activities |
| Build with Claude | ✅ Me | Core loop |

### The Reality

**This is already happening.**

- LLC is filed
- Product exists (Truth Engine)
- First outreach done (Mo Lam)
- Inbound contact arrived (Ashutosh at Google)
- EdTech targets identified (Renaissance, Ellucian, Civitas, GoGuardian, Clever)
- Funding tracker created
- One-pager written

### Verdict: ✅ This Is The Business

Everything about this is Me:
- Build with AI (Me)
- Explain to interested parties (Me)
- Close deals (Me)
- Apply for founder programs (Me)
- No cold calling (check)
- No selling (check - explaining and closing instead)
- No performing (check)

## Business 7: Mo Lam / Peterson's as First Customer

**The Pitch:** Not a separate business - this is the first customer for Credential Atlas.

### Me/Not-Me Analysis

| Activity | Me/Not-Me | Reality Check |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Reach out to former boss | ✅ Me | Warm, not cold |
| Explain what I've built | ✅ Me | Natural |
| Propose value | ✅ Me | He knows my work |
| Navigate past relationship | ⚠️ Careful | Power dynamics shifted |
| Accept that he might say no | ✅ Me | Not attached to outcome |

### The Reality

Mo Lam knows Jeremy's work. Peterson's needs what Jeremy built (credential verification, AI governance). The relationship exists. This isn't sales - it's a conversation between people who know each other.

### Verdict: ✅ This Is The First Move

Credential Atlas + Mo Lam as first customer = the path.

## The Synthesis: What Business Is Jeremy?

### The Filter Results

| Business | Product Is Me | Go-To-Market Is Me | Verdict |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Personal Intelligence Consultant | ✅ | ❌ (wealthy strangers) | ❌ |
| AI Strategy Consultant | ✅ | ⚠️ (slow content path) | ⚠️ |
| Executive Coach | ⚠️ | ❌ (frame doesn't fit) | ❌ |
| Content Creator | ⚠️ | ❌ (consistency, performance) | ❌ |
| Fractional Executive | ✅ | ⚠️ (passive, platforms don't see) | ⚠️ |
| **Credential Atlas / EdTech** | ✅ | ✅ | **✅** |

- No cold calling required
- No selling required (explaining + closing instead)
- No performing required
- Financial runway through credits/grants while building

---

## The Secondary Plays

### Keep Active (Low Effort, Might Work)

1. **Fractional Executive Platforms** - Register, wait, see if they bite
2. **EdTech Cold List** - Not cold calling, but could have warm intros made

### Build Over Time (Not Now)

3. **Content/Courses** - If Jeremy writes naturally, it could become a product later
4. **AI Strategy Consulting** - If Credential Atlas succeeds, the consulting model becomes credible

### Abandon (Not Me)

5. **Personal Intelligence for wealthy individuals** - No access to market
6. **Executive Coaching** - Frame doesn't fit
7. **Traditional job search** - Not what he wants

---

## The Path Forward

### What Jeremy Does

1. **Reply to Ashutosh** (Google) - As founder, discuss programs
2. **Reach out to Mo Lam** - First customer conversation
3. **Apply for credits** - AWS, Azure, Anthropic
4. **Apply for Colorado grants** - When cycle opens
5. **Build with Claude** - Continue developing product
6. **Register on fractional platforms** - Low effort, might work

### What Jeremy Does Not Do

1. Cold call anyone
2. Sell anything
3. Perform for content
4. Wait for platforms to discover him
5. Pretend to be a coach
6. Build audience before revenue

---

## The Frame That Holds It All

**"I am a founder building AI verification infrastructure. The business is Credential Atlas. The product is Truth Engine. The market is EdTech and AI governance. The path is warm relationships and founder programs. I don't sell - I explain and close."**

This is the business. Everything else is either supporting activity or distraction.
