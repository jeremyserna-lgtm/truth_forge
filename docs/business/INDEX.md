## The Business Structure

| Entity | Role | Product |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Truth Engine** | Sells hardware + Genesis | NOT-ME ownership |
| **Primitive Engine** | Sells transformation | The Anvil relationship |
| **Credential Atlas** | Sells verification | Proof of what NOT-ME knows |

## The Core Insight

> "One person. One NOT-ME. One year."

This is the atomic unit. Everything derives from this.

- Credential Atlas? Verification of what the NOT-ME knows.
- Primitive Engine? Transformation through the NOT-ME.
- Stage5Mind? Discovery platform for finding your NOT-ME.
- Fleet/Empire? Multiple NOT-MEs for multiple purposes.

But at the primitive level: **One person. One NOT-ME. One year.**
