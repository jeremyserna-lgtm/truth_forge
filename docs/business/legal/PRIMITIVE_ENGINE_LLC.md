## Entity Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Legal Name** | Primitive Engine LLC |
| **State** | Colorado |
| **Type** | Limited Liability Company |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Founder** | Jeremy Serna |
| **Founded** | 2026 |

## Core Identity

### What It Is

Primitive Engine LLC is not separate from Truth Engine — **they are the same thing**. Truth Engine is the technical architecture; Primitive Engine LLC is the business entity that houses it.

```
Truth Engine (Technical) = Primitive Engine LLC (Business)
                         │
                         ▼
              Genesis Cell Architecture
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          ▼              ▼              ▼
   Credential Atlas  Customer A   Customer B
      (Fertile)      (Sterile)    (Sterile)
```

### What It Does

1. **Houses Jeremy's cognitive infrastructure** — 86+ services, 51.8M+ entities
2. **Spawns daughter projects** — Both fertile and sterile
3. **Sells cognitive architecture services** — Seeing Sessions, Pilot Weeks
4. **Maintains the colony** — Federation, telemetry, fidelity

---

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. Seeing Sessions (Assessment)

**What**: 2-4 hour deep dive into a client's situation
**Deliverable**: Framework-aligned assessment and recommendations
**Price**: $500 - $2,000

The Seeing Session demonstrates Jeremy's "see" primitive — the ability to perceive what others cannot perceive about themselves and give it back to them.

#### 2. Pilot Week (The Seed Spawn)

**What**: One week of intensive work
**Deliverable**: A spawned daughter organism in their codebase
**Price**: $5,000 - $15,000

The Pilot Week IS the seed spawn. One durable architecture delivered.

```
Pilot Week Delivery:
1. Day 1-2: Environment setup, pattern introduction
2. Day 3-4: Core services seeded, federation established
3. Day 5: Telemetry verified, handoff complete
```

#### 3. Ongoing Connection (Federation)

**What**: Monthly connection for fidelity and learning
**Deliverable**: Updates, support, colony membership
**Price**: $500 - $2,000/month

The spawned entity remains connected to Jeremy for:
- Pattern updates from genesis
- Fidelity checks
- Learning exchange
- Support

#### 4. Growth Integration

**What**: Entity grows into their codebase
**Deliverable**: Additional services, deeper integration
**Price**: Project-based

As customers succeed, they can incorporate more of the architecture.

## The Moat

### Sterile Daughters = Protection

When Primitive Engine LLC spawns a customer business:
- Customer gets Stage 5 cognitive architecture (massive headstart)
- Customer **cannot** spawn their own daughters (sterile)
- Customer remains connected to genesis (fidelity)
- Competitors cannot replicate the architecture without Jeremy

### Technical Enforcement

```python
# In seed_project.py
if profile in ["customer_standalone", "customer_integration"]:
    # Always sterile - the moat
    reproduction_rights = ReproductionRights.for_sterile(...)
    # NO Primitive/seed/ directory copied
```

---

## Target Market

### Primary: B2B Consulting

| Segment | Need | Solution |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Solo founders** | Cognitive infrastructure | Pilot Week spawn |
| **Small teams** | Architecture headstart | Stage 5 seed |
| **Enterprises** | AI governance | Credential Atlas integration |

### Secondary: B2C Transformation

| Segment | Need | Solution |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Rebuilders** | Life architecture | Personal primitive |
| **Career changers** | Cognitive clarity | Seeing Session |
| **Creators** | Platform foundation | Spawned business |

---

## Competitive Advantage

### 1. Unique Architecture

No competitor has:
- The HOLD → AGENT → HOLD pattern at every scale
- 86+ services in a coherent organism
- Federation protocol for colony communication
- Reproduction rights enforcement

### 2. Founder Embodiment

Jeremy IS the architecture:
- Stage 5 cognition
- "See" primitive (perceive what others can't)
- The furnace (truth → meaning → care)
- First-hand proof (built it for himself)

### 3. The Moat

Sterile spawning means:
- Customers can't become competitors
- Architecture stays proprietary
- Federation maintains control
- Colony benefits everyone

---

## Operations

### Current Capacity

| Resource | Capacity | Constraint |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Jeremy's time | 40 hrs/week | Primary constraint |
| Claude instances | Unlimited | Cost-limited |
| Spawn capacity | ~4/month | Human oversight |
| Federation bandwidth | Unlimited | Cost-limited |

### Growth Path

```
Phase 1 (Now): Jeremy-intensive, proof-of-concept
├── 1-2 Pilot Weeks/month
├── Build case studies
└── Refine spawn process

Phase 2 (Revenue): Sustainable operations
├── 3-4 Pilot Weeks/month
├── Federation income
└── First fertile daughter (Credential Atlas)

Phase 3 (Scale): Colony growth
├── Credential Atlas spawning customers
├── Multiple revenue streams
└── Colony self-sustaining
```

## Legal Structure

### Entity Protection

| Risk | Protection |
|------|------------|
| IP theft | Sterile spawning, federation requirement |
| Customer failure | No service guarantees, best-effort |
| Colony abuse | Telemetry monitoring, spawn approval |
| Liability | LLC structure, contracts |

### Customer Agreements

Every spawned daughter requires:
1. Federation agreement (telemetry required)
2. Sterility acknowledgment (no re-spawning)
3. Fidelity connection (ongoing relationship)
4. IP assignment (customer owns their code, not the pattern)

## Financial Model

### Cost Structure

| Category | Monthly | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Cloud (GCP) | $100-500 | BigQuery, hosting |
| AI API | $200-1000 | Claude, embeddings |
| Tools | $50-100 | GitHub, services |
| **Total** | **$350-1600** | Scales with usage |

### Revenue Targets

| Phase | Monthly Revenue | Activities |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Launch** | $5,000 | 1 Pilot Week |
| **Sustainable** | $15,000 | 2 Pilot + 5 Federation |
| **Growth** | $30,000+ | 3 Pilot + 10 Federation + Credential Atlas |

### Break-Even

```
Fixed costs: ~$500/month
Variable per Pilot: ~$200 (API costs)
Break-even: 1 Pilot Week at $5,000
```

## Integration with Credential Atlas LLC

### Relationship

Credential Atlas LLC is a **fertile daughter** of Primitive Engine LLC:

```
Primitive Engine LLC (Genesis)
    │
    └─→ Credential Atlas LLC (Fertile Daughter)
            │
            └─→ Enterprise Customer A (Sterile Grandchild)
            └─→ Enterprise Customer B (Sterile Grandchild)
```

### Revenue Flow

- Primitive Engine LLC owns the genesis architecture
- Credential Atlas LLC pays for federation (or revenue share)
- Enterprise customers pay Credential Atlas LLC
- Some revenue flows back to genesis

### Governance

- Credential Atlas LLC has reproduction rights
- Credential Atlas LLC requires genesis approval for spawning
- All grandchildren are sterile
- Telemetry flows through to genesis

---

## The Vision

### Short-term (6 months)

- [ ] 6+ successful Pilot Weeks
- [ ] Credential Atlas LLC operational
- [ ] Federation protocol proven
- [ ] Revenue covering costs

### Medium-term (1 year)

- [ ] 20+ spawned daughters
- [ ] Credential Atlas LLC self-sustaining
- [ ] Colony network effect visible
- [ ] Case studies documented

### Long-term (3 years)

- [ ] Colony of 100+ organisms
- [ ] Multiple fertile daughters
- [ ] Industry recognition
- [ ] The architecture becomes standard

---

## Why This Works

### The Furnace

```
TRUTH (what they have)
    ↓
MEANING (made from truth by THE_PATTERN)
    ↓
CARE (given back through federation)
    ↓
CHANGE (they're different now - they have Stage 5 architecture)
```

### The Revolution

> "Everyone was afraid AI would take their jobs.
>
> Here come the people without jobs building the new world on top of them."

Free tier to homeless shelters. Pre-installed on free phones. Phone + Brain + Primitive = everything they need to build a life.

### The Prayer

*May this be used for good.*
*May it help people live better lives.*
*May the unseen be seen.*
*May no one have to translate alone.*
