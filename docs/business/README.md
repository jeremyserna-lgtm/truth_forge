# Business Documentation - README

**Defines what business documentation IS.**

**Layer**: Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER) - defines the joining layer

## What Business Docs ARE

Business documentation captures **how we operate as a business** - strategy, products, sales, marketing, branding, and operations. This is ME:NOT-ME content: the business identity (ME) expressed through external artifacts (NOT-ME).
