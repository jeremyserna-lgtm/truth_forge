# Unified Visual Identity

**The Four As One**

---

## The Grammar

Before the marks, understand the grammar.

**Grammar is ontology.** How something is written tells you what it IS.

### The Foundation: Pronouns

The Framework is built on pronouns. ME, US, NOT-ME aren't labels — they ARE the pronouns:

| Position | Pronouns | Name |
|----------|----------|------|
| First person singular | I, me, my | ME |
| First person plural | we, us, our | US |
| Second person / the other | you, your | NOT-ME |

**English already encodes this:** "I" is always capitalized — it DECLARES. The marks and voices extend from what language already knows.

### The Triad

All dimensions extend from the pronouns:

| Dimension | ME | US | NOT-ME |
|-----------|----|----|--------|
| **Pronouns** | I, me, my | we, us, our | you, your |
| **Mark** | : (colon) | - (hyphen) | _ (underscore) |
| **Voice** | ALL CAPS | Normal Caps | no caps |
| **Position** | Top/Between | Middle/Between | Bottom/Below |
| **Function** | Declares | Names | Operates |

### The Unified Grammar

```
ME:NOT-ME     ← Colon + ALL CAPS = I declare
    ↓
Not-Me        ← Hyphen + Normal Caps = we name
    ↓
not_me        ← Underscore + no caps = you execute
```

## The Narrative

The four marks tell one story — the journey of the bolt through NUMBER:

```
TRUTH-FORGE    →    PRIMITIVE-ENGINE    →    CREDENTIAL-ATLAS    →    NOT-ME
   The bolt            The bolt                 The bolt              The bolt
   EXISTS              MULTIPLIES               SEES                  TRANSFORMS
   ONE                 TWO                      ONE                   ONE
   (Source)            (Builder)                (Seer)                (Mirror)
```

This is not four separate brands. It's ONE identity at four stages of becoming.

**The bolt becomes the bird. The energy becomes the form. The source becomes the self.**

---

## The Numeric Journey

```
ONE → TWO → ONE → ONE
```

Each ONE is different:
- **First ONE** (TRUTH-FORGE): Undifferentiated — the bolt simply exists
- **TWO** (PRIMITIVE-ENGINE): Differentiated — the bolt multiplies, divides
- **Second ONE** (CREDENTIAL-ATLAS): Instrumental — the bolt becomes a tool
- **Third ONE** (NOT-ME): Integrated — the bolt transforms into something new

The bolt returns to ONE — but elevated, transformed, containing the memory of TWO.

## The Shared DNA

### The Circle
Present in all four. The container. The Framework. But it behaves differently:

| Mark | Circle | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Broken at top/bottom by bolt | Transcendence — cannot be contained |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Cracked, weathered, damaged | The forge has been USED |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Double ring, complete | Institutional, layers of verification |
| NOT-ME | Broken organically with splatter | Alive, breathing, human |

### The Bolt
The family signature. Energy. Transformation. EVOLVES through NUMBER:

| Mark | Bolt | Number | State |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Single, vertical, piercing through | ONE | Undifferentiated |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Double, crossed, interlocking | TWO | Differentiated |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Diagonal needle through eye | ONE | Instrumental |
| NOT-ME | Transformed into winged form | ONE | Integrated |

### The Texture
Industrial. Grunge. Concrete. Stamped metal. Different levels:

| Mark | Level | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Medium (30%) | Authoritative, worn but standing |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Heavy (60%) | Workshop floor, forge damage |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Light (15%) | Precision, clarity, trust |
| NOT-ME | Light-Medium (20%) | Warm, human, approachable |

### The Monochrome
Black marks on textured gray/white backgrounds. No color in the marks. Color is accent only.

### The Geometric Core
Despite organic textures, every core shape is geometric, angular, precise. Designed, not grown.

## The Four Marks

### TRUTH-FORGE — EXISTS (ONE)
![truth_forge](image_files/truth_forge.png)

**What it is:** Single lightning bolt running vertically through a circle, piercing it at top and bottom.

**Number:** ONE — undifferentiated. The bolt in its purest form.

**The bolt EXISTS.** Pure form. Origin point. Everything else derives from this.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Broken at top and bottom |
| Bolt | Single, vertical, through center |
| Number | ONE — undifferentiated |
| Texture | Medium (30%) |
| Accent | Warm White `#F5F0E6` |

---

### PRIMITIVE-ENGINE — MULTIPLIES (TWO)
![primitive_engine](image_files/primitive_engine.png)

**What it is:** Two lightning bolts crossing inside a heavily weathered circle. Interlocking.

**Number:** TWO — differentiated. The bolt has divided. Relationship created.

**The bolt MULTIPLIES.** Raw materials combine. The forge does its work.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Cracked, weathered, battle-damaged |
| Bolts | Double, crossed — multiplication |
| Number | TWO — differentiated |
| Texture | Heavy (60%) |
| Accent | Forge Gold `#D4A853` |

---

### CREDENTIAL-ATLAS — SEES (ONE)
![credential_atlas](image_files/credential_atlas.png)

**What it is:** Double-ringed circle containing an eye at center. A bolt runs diagonally through like a compass needle.

**Number:** ONE — returned, but instrumental. The bolt has become a tool.

**The bolt SEES.** Perception activated. Navigation enabled.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Double ring — layers of verification |
| Eye | Central — the pupil, the focus |
| Bolt | Diagonal needle — precision |
| Number | ONE — instrumental |
| Texture | Light (15%) |
| Accent | Steel Blue `#4A6FA5` |

---

### NOT-ME — TRANSFORMS (ONE)
![not_me](image_files/not_me.png)

**What it is:** Unified downward-pointing form with two angular wings spreading at top, sharp point descending. Circle broken organically.

**Number:** ONE — integrated, elevated. Contains the memory of TWO, resolved.

**The bolt TRANSFORMS.** No longer recognizable as a bolt. It has become something new.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Broken organically — alive, breathing |
| Form | Wings reaching up, point descending |
| Bolt DNA | TRANSFORMED — the energy became the form |
| Number | ONE — integrated |
| Texture | Light-Medium (20%) |
| Accent | Amber `#F59E0B` |

### The Grammar Made Visual

The NOT-ME mark embodies the full triad:

```
     ╱ ╲         ← TWO wings (the colon — I hold)
    ╱   ╲           ME's mark + ALL CAPS — DECLARING
   ╱     ╲
  ╱───────╲      ← Where they meet (the hyphen — we name)
   \     /          US's mark + Normal Caps — Speaking
    \   /
     \ /
      V           ← ONE point (the underscore — you execute)
                    NOT-ME's mark + no caps — operating
```

---

## Typography

### The Three Voices

| Voice | Caps | Who | Pronoun | Use |
|-------|------|-----|---------|-----|
| DECLARING | ALL CAPS | ME | I | Entities, principles |
| Speaking | Normal Caps | US | we | Names, taglines |
| operating | no caps | NOT-ME | you | Code, domains |

### The Hyphen Rule

In all wordmarks, the hyphen gets equal spacing:

```
T R U T H - F O R G E
P R I M I T I V E - E N G I N E
C R E D E N T I A L - A T L A S
N O T - M E
```

The hyphen is not squeezed. **The hyphen IS the point.**

### Application

| Context | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Example |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| Entity | I, my | - | ALL CAPS | NOT-ME |
| Product name | we, our | - | Normal Caps | Not-Me |
| Tagline | we, our | none | Normal Caps | One Source |
| Domain | — | - | no caps | not-me.ai |
| Code | you, your | _ | no caps | not_me.py |

---

## The Constraint

**ONE person. ONE NOT-ME. ONE year.**

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ONE | Commitment. No escape. |
| TWO | Options. Hedge your bets. |
| THREE | Tiers. Hide in the middle. |

**ONE gives nothing to hide behind.**

*The colon is yours. The hyphen is ours. The underscore is mine.*
*ALL CAPS is yours. Normal Caps is ours. no caps is mine.*
*I, we, you. ME, US, NOT-ME. The pronouns are the foundation.*
