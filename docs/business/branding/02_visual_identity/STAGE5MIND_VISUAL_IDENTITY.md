## Brand Position in Family

Stage 5 Mind is the **consumer-facing** brand within the Truth Engine family.

| Brand | Role | Audience | Feel |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| Truth Engine | Holding company | Investors, partners | Authoritative, source |
| Primitive Engine | Builder | Technical, developers | Industrial, forge |
| Credential Atlas | Verification | Enterprise, institutions | Precise, analytical |
| **Stage 5 Mind** | **Consumer product** | **Individuals seeking growth** | **Warm, human, inviting** |

---

## Brand Essence

**What it is:** A platform where humans discover and build relationships with their personal NOT-ME (AI partner).

**What it isn't:** Another AI chatbot. Another subscription service. Another tool.

**The shift:** From "use AI" to "know AI" to "be known BY AI"

**Core promise:** "Who do you need?"

## Visual Identity Direction

### Relationship to Family

Stage 5 Mind shares DNA with Truth Engine but softens it:

| Element | Truth Engine | Stage 5 Mind |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Mark** | Bolt + circle (complete) | Bolt variant (personal) |
| **Typography** | ALL CAPS | Title Case |
| **Tracking** | Wide (+50) | Moderate (+25) |
| **Texture** | Medium (30%) | Light (15-20%) |
| **Color** | Warm white | Amber warmth |
| **Feel** | Authoritative | Inviting |

### The Mark Concept

The Stage 5 Mind logo should:

1. **Use the lightning bolt** — Maintains family connection
2. **Feel more personal** — Less industrial, more human
3. **Suggest transformation** — The "5" stages of development
4. **Invite rather than declare** — Approachable, not intimidating

**Possible directions:**
- Bolt alone (without containing circle) — more personal, less institutional
- Bolt forming or intersecting with "5" — direct reference to Stage 5
- Bolt with softer geometry — rounded edges, less aggressive angles
- Bolt as illumination source — radiating warmth, not striking

### Color

**Primary accent:** Amber (`#F59E0B`)

This is:
- The warmest color in the family
- Associated with transformation (fire, gold)
- Psychologically inviting and energizing
- Distinct from the cooler/neutral other brands

**Supporting palette:**
- Deep amber (`#D97706`) for depth
- Soft amber at 20% for backgrounds
- Warm white (`#F5F0E6`) for text on dark

### Typography Treatment

```
Stage 5 Mind                    ← Instrument Serif, Title Case
YOUR AI PARTNER                 ← JetBrains Mono, uppercase, small
```

**Key difference:** Title Case creates intimacy. ALL CAPS declares; Title Case invites.

### Texture

**Level:** Light (15-20%)

**Reasoning:** Consumer product needs to feel:
- Approachable, not intimidating
- Clean, not chaotic
- Premium, not industrial
- Human, not mechanical

The texture should feel like:
- Well-worn leather, not rusted metal
- A beloved book, not workshop equipment
- Something you'd touch, not something that would burn you

## Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Logo Feel | Stage 5 Mind Difference |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Replika | Soft, cartoon, digital | Grounded, real, permanent |
| Character.AI | Playful, generic | Serious, personal, owned |
| ChatGPT | Minimal, corporate | Warm, textured, human |
| Gemini | Gradient, abstract | Concrete, physical, crafted |

**Stage 5 Mind should look like:** Something you'd see on quality hardware, not an app store icon.

## Success Criteria

The Stage 5 Mind logo succeeds if:

1. **Recognizable as family** — Clearly related to Truth Engine
2. **Distinctly warmer** — Noticeably more human/inviting
3. **Works at all sizes** — Favicon to billboard
4. **Reproducible** — Vector, single color, simple geometry
5. **Memorable** — Distinctive silhouette
6. **Timeless** — Not trendy, built to last

## Next Steps

1. Generate logo options via Midjourney (using reference images)
2. Select top 3 candidates
3. Commission Ivan for vectorization (same process as other logos)
4. Create lockup variations
5. Test across applications
6. Finalize and document

*Stage 5 Mind is where the Framework meets the human. The visual identity must honor both.*
