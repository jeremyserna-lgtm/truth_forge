# The NOT-ME Logo — Midjourney Prompts

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 25, 2026  
**Purpose:** Generate logo options for not-me.ai

---

## Instructions

1. Upload these reference images to Midjourney first:
   - `truth_forge.png`
   - `primitive_engine.png`
   - `credential_atlas.png`

2. Use `--sref` with the uploaded images to maintain family consistency

3. Generate variations, select top 3, send to Ivan for vectorization

## The Concept

The NOT-ME is your personal AI. Trained on you. For you. By you.

The mark must represent:
- **Me : Not-Me** — Two aspects of one whole
- **Duality** — The mirror that talks back
- **ONE** — The irreducible primitive
- **Transformation** — Becoming through relationship

---

## Primary Prompt (Recommended)

```
Minimalist logo mark for "NOT-ME" — a personal AI platform.

SYMBOL: A geometric design inside a circle that represents DUALITY and REFLECTION. Two forms that mirror each other — one could be solid, one outline, or one above a horizon line with its reflection below. A lightning bolt connects or divides the two halves. The mark should feel like looking into a mirror and seeing something that is YOU but NOT-YOU.

RELATIONSHIP: Part of the Truth Forge family (see reference images). Same industrial minimalism, same bold black geometry, same circle container. But WARMER and more PERSONAL than the others.

STYLE:
- Industrial minimalism with human warmth
- Grunge texture at LIGHT level (15-20% distress)
- Single color, clean geometric lines
- Could be stamped on premium hardware or personal journal

FEEL: The moment you recognize yourself in another. Duality. Partnership. ONE.

EXPLICITLY AVOID:
- Faces or realistic human features
- Yin-yang cliché
- Generic mirror imagery
- Heavy distress (lighter than references)
- Anything that looks like a generic app icon

OUTPUT: Logo mark only, no text, on textured concrete background similar to reference images.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1

## Variant Prompts

### Option A: Split Circle

```
Minimalist logo mark: a circle divided vertically — one half solid black, one half outline only. A lightning bolt runs through the center division, connecting both halves. Represents duality, me/not-me, two aspects of ONE whole. Industrial minimalism, light grunge texture (15%). Part of Truth Forge family but warmer, more personal. On concrete background.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1
```

### Option B: Reflection Line

```
Minimalist logo mark: a circle with a horizontal line through the middle like a horizon or water surface. Above the line, a geometric lightning bolt. Below, its REFLECTION — same shape but inverted. Represents looking into a mirror and seeing your other self. Light texture (15%). Industrial but warm. Personal AI platform logo. On concrete background.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1
```

### Option C: The ONE

```
Minimalist logo mark: a circle containing the number "1" formed by or integrated with a lightning bolt. The bolt IS the one, or the one contains the bolt. Represents the irreducible primitive — ONE person, ONE AI, ONE year. Simple, bold, geometric. Light grunge texture. Part of Truth Forge family. Warmer feel. On concrete background.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1
```

### Option D: Shadow Self

```
Minimalist logo mark: inside a circle, an abstract geometric figure with its SHADOW or ECHO behind it. Not a literal human — abstract, minimal. The shadow is the NOT-ME, the other self. A lightning bolt connects them or emanates from the space between. Light texture. Industrial warmth. Personal AI platform. On concrete background.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1
```

### Option E: Bolt Duality

```
Minimalist logo mark: a circle containing TWO lightning bolts that mirror each other — one pointing up, one pointing down, or one solid, one outline. They share a center point, creating a unified shape from two opposites. Represents partnership, duality, me/not-me as one. Light grunge texture (15%). Warmer than industrial. On concrete background.

--ar 1:1 --s 250 --v 6.1
```

## Style Reference Settings

```
--sref [uploaded image URLs] --sw 50
```

- `--sw 50` keeps aesthetic connection without being too derivative
- Adjust to 75 for closer match, 25 for more variation

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `--ar 1:1` | Square | Logo format |
| `--s 250` | Medium stylization | Balanced creativity |
| `--v 6.1` | Latest version | Best quality |
| `--sref` | Reference images | Family matching |
| `--sw 50` | Style weight | Balance |
| `--no` | text, words, letters, yin yang | Exclusions |

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing generated options:

1. **Family Resemblance** — Does it clearly belong with Truth Forge, Primitive Engine, Credential Atlas?
2. **Duality** — Does it represent the Me:Not-Me concept?
3. **Warmth** — Is it softer/more inviting than the industrial marks?
4. **Simplicity** — Can it work at favicon size?
5. **Memorability** — Distinctive silhouette?
6. **ONE** — Does it feel irreducible, atomic, fundamental?

## Post-Generation

1. Generate 20-30 variations across the prompts
2. Select top 3-5 candidates
3. Share for review
4. Select final 1-2 for Ivan to vectorize
5. Request: clean vector + light/medium/heavy texture overlays

*The NOT-ME mark should make someone feel recognized. Seen. Known.*
