### The Mark
![primitive_engine.png](../image_files/primitive_engine.png)

**The bolt MULTIPLIES.**

This is the workshop. The forge. Two bolts crossing — one traditional, one angular — interlocking. The circle is cracked, weathered, battle-damaged. This mark has WORKED.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Cracked, weathered — the forge has been used |
| Bolts | Double, crossed, interlocking — combination, construction |
| Texture | Heavy (60%) — workshop floor, forge damage |

### What It Means
The bolt from Truth Forge arrives here and multiplies. Raw materials combine. The forge does its work. This is where building happens. The heavy distress says: creation is not clean.

### The Bolt's Journey
**Stage 2 of 4: MULTIPLIES**

### Color Accent
Forge Gold — `#D4A853`
Molten metal, creation heat, the moment of transformation.
