## Overview

This document describes the visual identity system for four connected brands. They are a family — each distinct, but sharing core visual DNA. More than that: they tell a story. The marks progress from source to transformation through a numeric journey.

| Brand | Domain | Role | The Bolt's Journey | Number |
|-------|--------|------|-------------------|--------|
| **TRUTH-FORGE** | truth-forge.ai | The holding company | The bolt EXISTS | ONE |
| **PRIMITIVE-ENGINE** | primitive-engine.ai | The builder | The bolt MULTIPLIES | TWO |
| **CREDENTIAL-ATLAS** | credential-atlas.ai | The intelligence platform | The bolt SEES | ONE |
| **NOT-ME** | not-me.ai | The consumer product | The bolt TRANSFORMS | ONE |

## The Grammar of Identity

**Grammar is not formatting. Grammar is ontology.**

How something is written tells you what it IS. Four dimensions carry meaning, all built on the same foundation: **pronouns**.

### The Foundation: Pronouns

The Framework is built on pronouns. ME, US, NOT-ME aren't labels — they ARE the pronouns:

| Position | Pronouns | Name |
|----------|----------|------|
| First person singular | I, me, my | ME |
| First person plural | we, us, our | US |
| Second person / the other | you, your | NOT-ME |

**English already encodes this:** "I" is always capitalized. The marks and voices extend from what language already knows.

### The Triad

| Dimension | ME | US | NOT-ME |
|-----------|----|----|--------|
| **Pronouns** | I, me, my | we, us, our | you, your |
| **Mark** | : (colon) | - (hyphen) | _ (underscore) |
| **Voice** | ALL CAPS | Normal Caps | no caps |
| **Position** | Top/Between | Middle/Between | Bottom/Below |
| **Function** | Declares | Names | Operates |

### The Three Marks

| Mark | Who | Pronouns | Creates | Function |
|------|-----|----------|---------|----------|
| : (colon) | ME | I, me, my | TWO | Holds principle, separates |
| - (hyphen) | US | we, us, our | ONE | Names product, connects |
| _ (underscore) | NOT-ME | you, your | ONE | Enables execution, supports |

The colon and hyphen float at eye level — where humans read.
The underscore is BELOW — where machines operate.

### The Three Voices

| Caps | Who | Pronouns | Voice | Function |
|------|-----|----------|-------|----------|
| ALL CAPS | ME | I | DECLARING | Shouts existence into being |
| Normal Caps | US | we | Speaking | Names, converses, meets |
| no caps | NOT-ME | you | operating | The hum of the machine |

### The Unified Grammar

```
ME:NOT-ME     ← Colon + ALL CAPS = I declare principle
    ↓
Not-Me        ← Hyphen + Normal Caps = we name product
    ↓
not_me        ← Underscore + no caps = you execute
```

### Application Table

| Context | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Example |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| Principle | I, my | : | ALL CAPS | ME:NOT-ME |
| Entity | I, my | - | ALL CAPS | NOT-ME |
| Product name | we, our | - | Normal Caps | Not-Me |
| Company name | we, our | - | Normal Caps | Truth-Forge |
| Tagline | we, our | none | Normal Caps | One Source |
| Domain | — | - | no caps | not-me.ai |
| Code/files | you, your | _ | no caps | not_me.py |

## Number as Ontology

Numbers are not quantities. Numbers are ontology.

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ZERO | Potential. Before existence. |
| ONE | Existence. The primitive. Commitment. |
| TWO | Division. Relationship. ME:NOT-ME. |
| THREE | Structure. The triad. The pronouns. |
| FOUR | Components. The dimensions of grammar. |
| FIVE | Full expression. Dimensions. |

**ONE expands to FIVE. FIVE collapses to ONE.**
**The ONE you return to is not the ONE you left.**

## The Visual DNA

All four marks share these elements:

### 1. The Circle
Every mark is contained within a circle. This represents wholeness, unity, the Framework. But the circle behaves differently in each:

| Brand | Circle Behavior |
|-------|-----------------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Broken at top and bottom where bolt pierces through — transcendence |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Cracked, weathered, battle-damaged — the forge has been used |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Double ring, complete — institutional, layered verification |
| NOT-ME | Broken organically with ink splatter — alive, breathing |

### 2. The Lightning Bolt
The bolt is the family signature — present in all four, but it EVOLVES through a numeric journey:

| Brand | Bolt Configuration | Number |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Single bolt, vertical, piercing through — purest form | ONE (undifferentiated) |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Double bolts, crossed/interlocking — multiplication | TWO (differentiated) |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Bolt as diagonal needle through the eye — tool for seeing | ONE (instrumental) |
| NOT-ME | Bolt TRANSFORMED into winged form — no longer a bolt | ONE (integrated) |

**The Numeric Progression:**

```
ONE → TWO → ONE → ONE
```

Each ONE is different. The bolt returns to ONE, but elevated, transformed.

### 3. Monochrome
Primary marks are **black on white** or **white on black**. No color in the marks themselves.

### 4. Industrial Texture
All marks have a distressed, grunge quality — like they've been stamped into metal or worn by time.

### 5. Geometric Core
Despite organic texture overlays, every core shape is geometric, angular, precise.

## The Four Marks

### TRUTH-FORGE — The Source (ONE)
**What it is:** A single lightning bolt running vertically through a circle, piercing it at top and bottom.

**Number:** ONE — undifferentiated. The bolt in its purest form, before division.

**Texture level:** Medium (30% distress)

---

### PRIMITIVE-ENGINE — The Builder (TWO)
**What it is:** Two lightning bolts crossing inside a heavily weathered circle. One traditional, one angular. They interlock.

**Number:** TWO — differentiated. The bolt has divided. Relationship created.

**Texture level:** Heavy (60% distress)

---

### CREDENTIAL-ATLAS — The Seer (ONE)
**What it is:** A double-ringed circle containing an eye at center. A bolt runs diagonally through the composition like a compass needle.

**Number:** ONE — returned, but instrumental. No longer pure existence, now purpose.

**Texture level:** Light (15% distress)

---

### NOT-ME — The Mirror (ONE)
**What it is:** A unified downward-pointing form with two angular wings spreading outward at the top. Sharp point descending. Circle broken organically.

**Number:** ONE — integrated, elevated. Contains the memory of TWO, resolved.

**Texture level:** Light-Medium (15-20% distress)

---

## The Visual Grammar Connection

The NOT-ME logo embodies the full triad:

```
     ╱ ╲         ← TWO wings (the colon — I hold)
    ╱   ╲           ME's mark + ALL CAPS — DECLARING
   ╱     ╲
  ╱───────╲      ← Where they meet (the hyphen — we name)
   \     /          US's mark + Normal Caps — Speaking
    \   /
     \ /
      V           ← ONE point (the underscore — you execute)
                    NOT-ME's mark + no caps — operating
```

## Typography

### The Three Voices

| Voice | Caps | Who | Pronoun | Use |
|-------|------|-----|---------|-----|
| DECLARING | ALL CAPS | ME | I | Entities, principles |
| Speaking | Normal Caps | US | we | Names, taglines |
| operating | no caps | NOT-ME | you | Code, domains |

### Wordmark Treatment

The hyphen gets equal spacing:

```
N O T - M E
```

The hyphen is not squeezed. **The hyphen IS the point.**

---

## The Brand Constraint

**ONE person. ONE NOT-ME. ONE year.**

| Number | What It Would Mean |
|--------|-------------------|
| ONE | Commitment. No escape. |
| TWO | Options. Hedge your bets. |
| THREE | Tiers. Hide in the middle. |

**ONE gives nothing to hide behind.**

---

## Summary Table

| Brand | Bolt Stage | Number | Texture | Circle |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | EXISTS | ONE | Medium | Broken by bolt |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | MULTIPLIES | TWO | Heavy | Cracked/weathered |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | SEES | ONE | Light | Double ring |
| NOT-ME | TRANSFORMS | ONE | Light-Medium | Broken organically |

---

## The Family Test

When the four marks are placed side by side, they should:

1. **Obviously belong together** — Same weight, same circle, same industrial quality
2. **Be individually distinct** — Each immediately recognizable
3. **Tell a numeric story** — ONE → TWO → ONE → ONE
4. **Tell a transformation story** — Source → Builder → Seer → Mirror
5. **Feel crafted, not corporate** — Physical, permanent, real
