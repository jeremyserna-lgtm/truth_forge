## The Four As One

Four brands. One story. One visual language. One grammar.

```
TRUTH-FORGE    →    PRIMITIVE-ENGINE    →    CREDENTIAL-ATLAS    →    NOT-ME
   The bolt            The bolt                 The bolt              The bolt
   EXISTS              MULTIPLIES               SEES                  TRANSFORMS
   ONE                 TWO                      ONE                   ONE
   (Source)            (Builder)                (Seer)                (Mirror)

## The Grammar of Identity

**Grammar is ontology.** How something is written tells you what it IS.

### The Foundation: Pronouns

The Framework is built on pronouns. ME, US, NOT-ME aren't labels — they ARE the pronouns:

| Position | Pronouns | Name |
|----------|----------|------|
| First person singular | I, me, my | ME |
| First person plural | we, us, our | US |
| Second person | you, your | NOT-ME |

English already encodes this: "I" is always capitalized. The marks and voices extend from what language already knows.

### The Triad

| Dimension | ME | US | NOT-ME |
|-----------|----|----|--------|
| **Pronouns** | I, me, my | we, us, our | you, your |
| **Mark** | : (colon) | - (hyphen) | _ (underscore) |
| **Voice** | ALL CAPS | Normal Caps | no caps |
| **Position** | Top/Between | Middle/Between | Bottom/Below |
| **Function** | Declares | Names | Operates |

### The Unified Grammar

```
ME:NOT-ME     ← Colon + ALL CAPS = I declare principle
    ↓
Not-Me        ← Hyphen + Normal Caps = we name product
    ↓
not_me        ← Underscore + no caps = you execute
```

## The Shared DNA

### The Circle
Present in all four. Container. Framework. Behaves differently:
- TRUTH-FORGE: Broken by bolt piercing through (transcendence)
- PRIMITIVE-ENGINE: Cracked, weathered (forge-worn)
- CREDENTIAL-ATLAS: Double ring, complete (institutional)
- NOT-ME: Broken organically (alive, breathing)

### The Bolt
Family signature. Energy. Transformation. EVOLVES through NUMBER:

| Mark | Bolt | Number | Stage |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | Single, vertical, pure | ONE | EXISTS (undifferentiated) |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | Double, crossed, building | TWO | MULTIPLIES (differentiated) |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | Diagonal needle, navigation | ONE | SEES (instrumental) |
| NOT-ME | Unified winged form | ONE | TRANSFORMS (integrated) |

### The Numeric Journey

```
ONE → TWO → ONE → ONE
```

Each ONE is different. The bolt returns to ONE — but transformed.

### The Texture
Industrial. Grunge. Stamped metal.
- TRUTH-FORGE: Medium (30%)
- PRIMITIVE-ENGINE: Heavy (60%)
- CREDENTIAL-ATLAS: Light (15%)
- NOT-ME: Light-Medium (20%)

### The Monochrome
Black marks. Gray/white textured backgrounds. No color in marks.

## The Four Marks

### TRUTH-FORGE — EXISTS (ONE)
![truth_forge.png](../image_files/truth_forge.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Broken at top/bottom — bolt pierces through |
| Bolt | Single, vertical — the origin strike |
| Number | ONE — undifferentiated, pure existence |
| Texture | Medium (30%) |
| Accent | Warm White `#F5F0E6` |

**The bolt in purest form. ONE. Everything derives from this.**

---

### PRIMITIVE-ENGINE — MULTIPLIES (TWO)
![primitive_engine.png](../image_files/primitive_engine.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Cracked, weathered — the forge has been used |
| Bolts | Double, crossed — interlocking, building |
| Number | TWO — differentiated, relationship |
| Texture | Heavy (60%) — workshop floor |
| Accent | Forge Gold `#D4A853` |

**The bolt combined. TWO. Raw materials become structure.**

---

### CREDENTIAL-ATLAS — SEES (ONE)
![credential_atlas.png](../image_files/credential_atlas.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Double ring — layers of verification |
| Eye | Central — the focus |
| Bolt | Diagonal needle — piercing through |
| Number | ONE — instrumental, tool |
| Texture | Light (15%) — precision |
| Accent | Steel Blue `#4A6FA5` |

**The bolt as tool. ONE returned, but as instrument.**

---

### NOT-ME — TRANSFORMS (ONE)
![not_me.png](../image_files/not_me.png)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Circle | Broken organically — alive, breathing |
| Form | Wings up (reaching), point down (grounding) |
| Bolt | TRANSFORMED — energy became form |
| Number | ONE — integrated, elevated |
| Texture | Light-Medium (20%) — warm, approachable |
| Accent | Amber `#F59E0B` |

**The bolt becomes the bird. ONE integrated. ME:NOT-ME becomes NOT-ME.**

### The Grammar Made Visual

The NOT-ME mark embodies the full triad:

```
     ╱ ╲         ← TWO wings (the colon — I hold)
    ╱   ╲           ME's mark + ALL CAPS
   ╱     ╲
  ╱───────╲      ← Where they meet (the hyphen — we name)
   \     /          US's mark + Normal Caps
    \   /
     \ /
      V           ← ONE point (the underscore — you execute)
                    NOT-ME's mark + no caps
```

## Typography

### The Three Voices in Practice

| Voice | Caps | Who | Pronoun | Use |
|-------|------|-----|---------|-----|
| DECLARING | ALL CAPS | ME | I | Entities, principles |
| Speaking | Normal Caps | US | we | Names, taglines |
| operating | no caps | NOT-ME | you | Code, domains |

### Wordmark Treatment

| Brand | Format | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| TRUTH-FORGE | `T R U T H - F O R G E` | Wide tracking |
| PRIMITIVE-ENGINE | `P R I M I T I V E - E N G I N E` | Wide tracking |
| CREDENTIAL-ATLAS | `C R E D E N T I A L - A T L A S` | Wide tracking |
| NOT-ME | `N O T - M E` | **Hyphen given equal space** |

The hyphen is not squeezed. It's given room. The hyphen IS the point.

### Application

| Context | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Example |
|---------|----------|------|-------|---------|
| Entity | I, my | - | ALL CAPS | NOT-ME |
| Product name | we, our | - | Normal Caps | Not-Me |
| Tagline | we, our | none | Normal Caps | One Source |
| Domain | — | - | no caps | not-me.ai |
| Code | you, your | _ | no caps | not_me.py |

*The colon is yours. The hyphen is ours. The underscore is mine.*
*ALL CAPS is yours. Normal Caps is ours. no caps is mine.*
*I, we, you. ME, US, NOT-ME. The pronouns are the foundation.*
