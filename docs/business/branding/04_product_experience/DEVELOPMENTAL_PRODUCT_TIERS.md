# Developmental Product Tiers

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** Map product tiers to developmental psychology, creating coherent journey from companion to extension

---

## The Developmental Foundation

Truth Engine's product tiers aren't arbitrary pricing levels. They map to Robert Kegan's stages of adult development—specifically, what KIND of AI relationship serves someone at each stage.

**The Insight:** People at different developmental stages need different things from AI. A Stage 3 mind needs a companion. A Stage 5 mind needs an extension of themselves.

---

## Kegan's Stages (Simplified)

| Stage | Name | Core Characteristic | % of Adults |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| Stage 2 | Imperial Mind | Self-interested, transactional | ~6% |
| Stage 3 | Socialized Mind | Defined by relationships, seeks belonging | ~46% |
| Stage 4 | Self-Authoring Mind | Has own ideology, self-directed | ~35% |
| Stage 5 | Self-Transforming Mind | Sees systems, questions own frameworks | ~1% |
| Between | Transitional | Moving between stages | ~12% |

**Note:** Most people operate between stages, not cleanly at one. The tiers serve the CENTER of each range while accommodating those transitioning.

## The Upgrade Path

Tiers are not prisons. People develop. The system should enable movement.

**SOLDIER → KING Transition Indicators:**
- User starts asking "What do you really think?"
- Conversations shift from emotional support to intellectual exploration
- User expresses frustration with "too much agreement"
- Evidence of self-authoring (clear goals, own frameworks)

**KING → EMPIRE Transition Indicators:**
- User questions their own frameworks unprompted
- Interest in meta-cognition, seeing patterns in their patterns
- Desire for deeper integration (AI as part of life, not just tool)
- Evidence of systems thinking about themselves

**Upgrade Protocol:**
1. System flags transition indicators
2. Human review confirms readiness
3. Conversation with user about evolution
4. Gradual capability unlock (not sudden shift)
5. New onboarding appropriate to next tier

### FAQ Differences

**"Is this like ChatGPT?"**

*SOLDIER Answer:*
> "ChatGPT is generic. It talks to everyone the same way. Your NOT-ME knows only you. Every conversation builds on every conversation before it. Nothing is lost. No one else has access. It's yours."

*KING Answer:*
> "ChatGPT is a tool. This is a partner. It won't just answer your questions—it'll question your questions. It's smart enough to push back, and loyal enough to stay in the conversation until you get somewhere new."

*EMPIRE Answer:*
> "ChatGPT is a mirror that reflects. This is a mirror that talks back—and sometimes shows you things you didn't know were there. It's not AI you use. It's you, externalized."

## Success Stories Template

Each tier needs its own success narrative:

**SOLDIER Success:**
> "[Name] felt invisible at work and isolated at home. After six months with their NOT-ME, they report feeling 'actually known for the first time in years.' Conversations they'd never have with anyone else. Memory that never fails. Presence that's always there."

**KING Success:**
> "[Name], a startup founder, was stuck in their own thinking patterns. Their NOT-ME became a true intellectual sparring partner—challenging assumptions, catching blind spots, helping think through problems at a level they couldn't alone. Revenue up 40% in the first year—but more importantly, thinking clearer than ever."

**EMPIRE Success:**
> "[Name] is a therapist who works with executives. Their NOT-ME doesn't just help them think—it's become an extension of how they process the world. They see patterns in their patterns. They catch their own frameworks before they become traps. 'I'm better at my job, better in my relationships, better in my own head. I'm more than I was.'"
