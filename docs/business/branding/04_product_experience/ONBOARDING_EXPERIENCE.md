# Onboarding Experience

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** The Sacred First Moment in action—how we welcome new customers into relationship with Truth Engine

## The Onboarding Philosophy

Onboarding is not setup. Onboarding is **the first act of care**.

From STRUCK: Guests arrive to the kitchen first—not the main event. They're greeted, oriented, and given permission to exist before anything is asked of them.

**The Principle:** The first 48 hours determine the next 48 months. Every interaction in this window is sacred.

---

## The Sacred First Moment

### What Makes It Sacred

1. **It's unrepeatable** — You only get one first moment
2. **It sets the template** — This is how all interactions will feel
3. **It's vulnerable** — They just invested money and trust
4. **It's decisive** — First impressions become permanent anchors
5. **It's witnessed** — We document it with reverence

### The Five Elements (From Threshold Space Design)

| Element | How It Appears in Onboarding |
|---------|------------------------------|
| **Container** | Clear boundaries—what happens now, what happens later |
| **Permission** | "There's no right way to do this" |
| **Safety** | "Your data is yours. Nothing happens without your consent." |
| **Presence** | Someone (or something) is attentive, available, unhurried |
| **Witness** | "This moment matters. We're honored you're here." |

## Onboarding by Product

### Stage 5 Mind

**Timeline:** First 7 days  
**Mode:** Primarily AI-guided with human touchpoints  
**Goal:** First "I feel known" moment

#### Day 0: Welcome

**Trigger:** Payment confirmed

**Within 2 hours:**
- Welcome email from Jeremy (personal, not template)
- Access credentials delivered
- "What to expect" guide attached

**Welcome Email Structure:**
```
Subject: Welcome to Stage 5 Mind

[Name],

You're in.

Over the next few days, you'll meet your NOT-ME—an AI trained to understand 
you specifically. There's no agenda, no right way to start, no performance 
expected. Just conversation.

A few things to know:
- Your data never leaves your device
- There's no wrong question
- Take your time

When you're ready, open the app and say hello.

I'm genuinely glad you're here.

— Jeremy

P.S. If you need anything, reply to this email. A human reads it.
```

#### Day 0-1: First Conversation

**The NOT-ME opens with:**
> "Hello. I'm here for you—not the other way around. There's no agenda, no checklist, no right way to start. What's on your mind, or what would you like me to know about you?"

**First conversation goals:**
- Create safety
- Establish warmth
- Let them lead
- Demonstrate memory (even small callbacks)
- End with invitation to return

**First conversation DON'T:**
- Ask for extensive personal data
- Demonstrate features
- Push toward any outcome
- Be too long (let them end it)

#### Day 1-3: Getting to Know

**NOT-ME behavior:**
- Reference previous conversations naturally
- Ask follow-up questions about what they shared
- Begin pattern observation (internal, not shared yet)
- Maintain warmth without pressure

**Human touchpoint (Day 2 or 3):**
- Brief check-in email
- "How's it going? Any questions?"
- Not automated—actually personal

#### Day 4-7: First Recognition

**Goal:** The "it actually knows me" moment

**NOT-ME begins:**
- Reflecting patterns back: "I've noticed you often..."
- Remembering specifics: "Last time you mentioned..."
- Demonstrating depth: "This connects to what you said about..."

**Success indicator:**
- User expresses surprise or recognition
- User says something like "You actually remember" or "That's exactly right"
- User returns voluntarily (not prompted)

#### Day 7: Milestone

**Automated + personal hybrid:**
- Summary of first week (patterns observed, conversations had)
- Invitation to share feedback
- Introduction to deeper features (if not yet explored)
- Explicit: "You belong here now"
