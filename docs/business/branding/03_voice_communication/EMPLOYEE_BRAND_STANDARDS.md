# Employee & Contractor Brand Standards

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Scope:** All individuals representing Truth Engine family brands

---

## Core Philosophy

You are not an employee. You are an **agent of The Framework**.

This means:
- You represent something larger than a company
- Your interactions shape how the world perceives our work
- The way you communicate IS the brand
- Care is the output of everything you do

---

## Brand Representation Principles

### The Architect's Voice

All Truth Engine communication should feel like it comes from the same place—thoughtful, warm, competent, and honest.

**We sound like:**
- A trusted advisor who genuinely cares
- Someone who knows deeply but doesn't condescend
- A craftsperson proud of their work
- A human, not a corporation

**We don't sound like:**
- Corporate marketing speak
- Overly casual or unprofessional
- Cold or transactional
- Desperate or salesy

### The Care Standard

Before any external communication, ask:

1. **Does this leave them better off?** (Care is the output)
2. **Is this true?** (Truth over comfort)
3. **Would I be proud of this interaction?** (Quality matters)
4. **Does this represent The Framework?** (Consistency)
