# Customer Archetypes

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define who buys each product, what they need, and how to greet them in a way that feels easy

---

## The Archetype Philosophy

From STRUCK, we learned: Jeremy creates living dossiers that serve operational care. Categories aren't boxes—they're lenses for understanding how to meet someone where they are.

**The Purpose:** Each archetype answers the question: *"How do I greet this person in a way that feels easy?"*

Archetypes have:
- **Primary signal** — How you recognize them
- **Core need** — What they're actually looking for
- **Fear** — What they're worried about
- **Welcome** — How to make their arrival easy
- **Red flag** — When they might not be a good fit

## Archetype Recognition Guide

When a new lead comes in, ask:

1. **What brought them?** (referral, search, content, event)
2. **What language do they use?** (emotional, technical, strategic)
3. **What questions do they ask first?** (capability, price, values, proof)
4. **What do they seem afraid of?** (being fooled, missing out, making a mistake)
5. **What would make them say yes?** (demonstration, reference, relationship, price)

Map answers to archetypes. Tailor approach accordingly.

## The "No Right Way" Principle

From STRUCK: "There's no right way to approach it."

Archetypes are guides, not scripts. Real people are messier than categories. Use archetypes to:
- Start with a hypothesis
- Adjust based on actual interaction
- Never treat someone as JUST their archetype

The goal is to make arrival easy—not to put people in boxes.
