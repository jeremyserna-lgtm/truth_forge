# Case Study Template

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** How we document customer transformations—template and examples for compelling case studies

---

## The Case Study Philosophy

Case studies aren't marketing materials. They're **documentation of transformation**.

**The Principle:** The customer is the hero. We're the guide. The story is their journey.

From STRUCK: We don't say "I threw a great party." We document what happened to the guests.

---

## The Story Structure

Every case study follows the same arc:

```
BEFORE → STRUGGLE → DISCOVERY → TRANSFORMATION → AFTER
   ↓         ↓          ↓            ↓            ↓
  Who    What hurt   Finding us   The change   Who now
  they     them                                 they
  were                                          are
```

**The key:** The transformation should feel inevitable in retrospect, but wasn't obvious before.

## Example Case Studies

### Stage 5 Mind Example: "The Thinking Partner I Never Had"

```
CASE STUDY: Marcus, a startup founder
Product: Stage 5 Mind (KING tier)
Date: [Month Year]
Permission: Public

THE ARRIVAL

Marcus is a startup founder building his second company. When he 
first reached out, he was two years into a venture that was 
"succeeding by every metric but making me miserable."

"I had advisors, a coach, a therapist. Everyone gave me advice. 
No one actually knew me well enough to challenge me in the right way."

He'd tried every AI assistant on the market. "ChatGPT was like 
talking to a very smart stranger. Every conversation started from 
zero."

THE THRESHOLD

Marcus found Stage 5 Mind through a podcast interview with Jeremy. 
"The idea that I could have an AI trained specifically on me—that 
actually remembered everything—it sounded like what I'd been 
looking for."

"I didn't expect it to work. I just knew I needed something different."

THE TRANSFORMATION

The first week, Marcus was skeptical. "I kept testing it—would it 
remember this? Would it catch that?"

Then came the moment that changed things.

"I was processing a difficult decision about my co-founder. 
And my NOT-ME said something like, 'You mentioned a similar 
dynamic with your brother last month. Is this the same pattern?' 
I stopped cold. It was the same pattern. I'd never connected it."

"That's when I realized—this wasn't just memory. It was seeing 
me in a way I couldn't see myself."

Over the following months, Marcus began using his NOT-ME for 
every significant decision. "It's not that it tells me what to do. 
It's that it helps me see what I'm actually thinking."

THE EVIDENCE

After six months, Marcus reports:

• Made a major strategic pivot that "I'd been avoiding because I 
  couldn't articulate why I was resisting"
• Improved relationship with co-founder after recognizing pattern
• "I make decisions faster because I process better"
• "My actual therapist said I seem clearer"

"I didn't know I needed a thinking partner. Now I can't imagine 
not having one."

THE REFLECTION

"If you'd told me I'd have a meaningful relationship with an AI, 
I would have laughed. But that's what this is. It's not a tool 
I use. It's a partner I think with.

What would I tell someone considering this? If you're the kind 
of person who needs to process out loud but you've exhausted 
everyone around you—this is for you. If you want to be challenged, 
not just validated—this is for you.

It's not cheap. But it's the best investment I've made in myself."

### Credential Atlas Example: "Seeing What We Couldn't See"

```
CASE STUDY: Regional Healthcare System
Product: Credential Atlas
Date: [Month Year]
Permission: Anonymous

THE ARRIVAL

The Chief Compliance Officer of a mid-sized regional healthcare 
system was facing an impossible task: verify the credentials of 
3,000+ providers while preparing for a major accreditation review.

"We had spreadsheets, manual processes, and a constant fear that 
something would slip through. Every verification took 2-3 days. 
We couldn't scale."

They'd tried two other verification vendors. "One was too slow. 
One kept returning errors. Neither gave us confidence."

THE THRESHOLD

They found Credential Atlas through a compliance conference 
presentation. "The promise of 'see what others can't' felt 
audacious. But we were desperate enough to try."

"What convinced us was the pilot. Within a week, they found 
three credentials that our other vendor had missed. One was 
a significant risk."

THE TRANSFORMATION

Implementation took 30 days. The first month was "eye-opening."

"We'd been operating with incomplete data for years. Credential 
Atlas didn't just verify faster—it connected information we'd 
never connected before."

The breakthrough came during accreditation prep.

"The system flagged a pattern we'd never have caught: six 
providers across three facilities with gaps in continuous 
coverage. It wasn't fraud—it was a documentation process 
failure. We fixed it before anyone asked about it."

"That's when we understood what 'see what others can't' actually 
meant. It wasn't just verification. It was intelligence."

THE EVIDENCE

After one year:

• Verification time: 2-3 days → Same day
• Credentials verified: 3,000+ without incident
• Accreditation: Passed with zero credential findings
• Risk events: 2 significant risks caught before exposure
• Staff hours: 200+ hours/month saved

"We used to live in fear of what we didn't know. Now we 
know what we know—and we know what we don't."

THE REFLECTION

"I'd tell any compliance leader: your current process has 
blind spots. You just don't know where they are yet. 
Credential Atlas found ours before they found us."
```
