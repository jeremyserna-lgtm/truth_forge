# Sales Playbook

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** How to actually close deals—the complete sales methodology for Truth Engine brands

---

## The Sales Philosophy

We don't sell. We help people recognize what they already need.

**The Principle:** If someone needs to be convinced, they're not our customer. Our job is to find people who already feel the gap and show them we fill it.

**From STRUCK:** "There's no right way to approach it." The same applies to sales. Meet them where they are. Don't force a path.

## The Anti-Sales Sale

### What We're NOT Doing

| Traditional Sales | Truth Engine Sales |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Overcome objections | Understand concerns |
| Create urgency | Respect timing |
| Pitch features | Ask questions |
| Close hard | Make it easy to say yes or no |
| Maximize deal size | Find right fit |
| Follow scripts | Follow principles |

### What We ARE Doing

1. **Listening first** — Understand before proposing
2. **Qualifying honestly** — Not everyone is a fit, and that's good
3. **Educating genuinely** — Share value before asking for anything
4. **Making it easy** — Clear pricing, clear process, clear outcomes
5. **Respecting no** — A clean no is better than a reluctant yes

## Objection Handling

### The Philosophy

Objections aren't problems. They're information. Each objection tells you something about what the person needs to feel before saying yes.

**Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge** — "I hear you" / "That makes sense"
2. **Explore** — "Tell me more about that concern"
3. **Address** — Directly, honestly, with evidence
4. **Check** — "Does that help?" / "What else is there?"

### Common Objections by Product

**Stage 5 Mind**

| Objection | What They're Really Saying | Response |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| "It's expensive" | "I'm not sure about the value" | "What would it be worth to you if it actually worked?" |
| "I can use ChatGPT" | "Convince me this is different" | "You can. The difference is [ownership, training, permanence]. Is that difference valuable to you?" |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "I'm afraid of making a mistake" | "We offer [guarantee/trial]. But more importantly—what would 'working' look like for you?" |
| "I need to think about it" | "Something's not resolved" | "Of course. What specifically are you weighing?" |

**Credential Atlas**

| Objection | What They're Really Saying | Response |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| "We have a vendor for this" | "Why should I switch?" | "Tell me about them. What's working? What isn't?" |
| "The timing isn't right" | "This isn't urgent enough" | "What would need to happen for timing to be right?" |
| "I need to involve others" | "I can't decide alone" | "Of course. How can I help you make that case internally?" |
| "This seems complicated" | "I'm overwhelmed" | "Let's simplify. What's the one problem you most need solved?" |

**Primitive Engine**

| Objection | What They're Really Saying | Response |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|
| "I can build this myself" | "Prove your value" | "You absolutely can. The question is whether your time is better spent building or using." |
| "How do I know it will work?" | "I've been burned" | "Here's exactly how we de-risk it: [pilot, guarantee, references]" |
| "This is a big investment" | "I need to justify this" | "It is. Let's talk about what success looks like and work backward from there." |

## Pricing Conversations

### The Principles

1. **Never apologize for price** — We're premium for a reason
2. **Always explain value first** — Price is meaningless without context
3. **Be direct** — State the price clearly, then stop talking
4. **Offer options** — Tiers let people choose their fit

### The Script

> "Based on what you've shared, I'd recommend [tier/solution]. The investment is [price]. That includes [key components]. How does that land with you?"

Then **stop talking**. Let them respond.

### If They Push Back on Price

> "I hear you. Help me understand—is it that the number is higher than expected, or that you're not sure about the value?"

**If higher than expected:** "Let me explain how we arrived at this..." (walk through value)

**If not sure about value:** "What would you need to see to feel confident this is worth it?"

### Payment Options

| Product | Standard | Financing |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Stage 5 Mind | Full payment | 12-24 month option |
| Credential Atlas | Annual contract | Quarterly option (premium) |
| Primitive Engine | 50/50 (start/delivery) | Milestone-based |

---

## The Close

### When to Close

Close when:
- They've expressed clear interest
- Objections have been addressed
- They have the information they need
- The timing feels right

Don't close when:
- They're still exploring
- Major concerns remain unaddressed
- They need to involve others who aren't present
- It feels forced

### The Soft Close

> "It sounds like this could be a good fit. Would you like to move forward?"

### The Direct Close

> "Based on our conversation, I think [solution] is right for you. The next step is [contract/payment/onboarding]. Ready to proceed?"

### The Future Close

> "It sounds like the timing isn't quite right. Let's reconnect in [timeframe]. In the meantime, [value offering to stay connected]."

### After the Yes

1. Express genuine appreciation (not over-the-top)
2. Confirm next steps immediately
3. Send follow-up within 2 hours
4. Begin onboarding process
5. Ensure Sacred First Moment is set up

### After the No

1. Thank them for their time
2. Ask if you can follow up in the future
3. Offer continued value (content, resources)
4. Document what you learned
5. Move on—no guilt, no pressure

*We don't sell. We help people recognize what they already need. The best sale is one where the customer feels like they decided, not like they were convinced.*
