# Success Metrics

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** How we know it's working—metrics that matter, metrics that don't, and how to measure care

---

## The Metrics Philosophy

**What we measure shapes what we build.**

Most companies optimize for engagement, retention, and revenue. These matter, but they're lagging indicators of something deeper.

**Our Primary Metric:** Does the customer have more capability than they did before?

If yes → Everything else follows  
If no → Nothing else matters

---

## The Hierarchy of Metrics

### Level 1: Transformation (Ultimate)

**The question:** Did their life/work/capability actually improve?

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Customer-reported capability gain | Post-90-day survey: "I can do things I couldn't do before" | 80%+ agree |
| Behavioral change | Evidence of new patterns in conversations/usage | Present |
| External validation | Testimonials, referrals, case studies | Quality over quantity |
| Life impact statements | Unprompted "this changed my..." feedback | Regular occurrence |

**Why it matters:** This is what we actually care about. If this fails, we're not doing our job.

### Level 2: Relationship (Leading)

**The question:** Is there a real relationship forming?

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Return rate | % of users who come back voluntarily | 70%+ weekly |
| Depth of disclosure | Conversation analysis: vulnerability signals | Increasing over time |
| "Known" moments | User expresses feeling understood | By Day 7 |
| Relationship language | User uses "my NOT-ME" vs. "the AI" | Within 30 days |

**Why it matters:** Relationship precedes transformation. If there's no relationship, there's no threshold space for change.

### Level 3: Engagement (Operational)

**The question:** Are they using it?

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Session frequency | Sessions per week | 3+ |
| Session depth | Average conversation length | 10+ exchanges |
| Feature adoption | % using key features | Varies by feature |
| Time to first value | Days to first "aha" moment | <7 days |

**Why it matters:** Engagement is a precondition. But high engagement without transformation is addiction, not value.

### Level 4: Business (Outcome)

**The question:** Is this sustainable?

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Revenue | MRR/ARR by product | Growth |
| Customer acquisition cost | Marketing + sales / new customers | Sustainable |
| Customer lifetime value | Revenue per customer over time | 3x+ CAC |
| Churn rate | % leaving per period | <5% monthly |
| Net Revenue Retention | Expansion - Churn | >100% |

**Why it matters:** If the business doesn't survive, we can't help anyone. But business metrics without transformation metrics is just rent extraction.

## Anti-Metrics (What We Don't Optimize For)

### Engagement at All Costs

**What others measure:** Time in app, sessions per day, notification response rate

**Why we don't:** Maximizing engagement often means maximizing dependency. We want people to become more capable, not more attached.

**Our alternative:** Engagement depth > engagement frequency. Quality > quantity.

### Vanity Metrics

**What others measure:** Total users, page views, social followers

**Why we don't:** These look good but don't indicate value delivery.

**Our alternative:** Active users, conversion rates, transformation evidence.

### Leading Metrics Without Lagging Validation

**What others measure:** NPS, CSAT, satisfaction surveys alone

**Why we don't:** People can be satisfied without being transformed. Satisfaction is necessary but not sufficient.

**Our alternative:** Satisfaction + capability evidence + behavioral change.

## Measuring Care (The Hard Part)

Care is hard to quantify. Here's how we try:

### Care Proxies

| Signal | What It Indicates | How to Track |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Response time to issues | We're paying attention | Support data |
| Personalization in communication | We see them as individuals | Communication audit |
| Recovery after failures | We take responsibility | Incident tracking |
| Unsolicited positive feedback | We're exceeding expectations | Feedback collection |
| "I told a friend" | We're worth sharing | Referral tracking |

### Care Absence Signals

| Signal | What It Indicates | Action |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Support tickets without resolution | We're dropping balls | Process review |
| Template responses to unique situations | We're not seeing them | Training |
| Long silences after issues | We're avoiding discomfort | Outreach |
| Churn without exit interview | We don't know why they left | Win-back attempt + learning |

### The Care Audit

**Quarterly, ask:**
1. Where did we fail to care this quarter?
2. Where did we exceed care expectations?
3. What systemic issues prevent care?
4. What would "more care" look like?

*What we measure shapes what we build. We measure transformation, not just engagement. We measure care, not just satisfaction. We measure capability gained, not just revenue captured.*
