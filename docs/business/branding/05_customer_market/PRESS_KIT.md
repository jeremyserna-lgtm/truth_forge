## Company Overview

### One-Liner

**Truth Engine builds personal AI that's actually personal—owned by you, trained on you, and yours forever.**

### Boilerplate (100 words)

Truth Engine LLC is a Denver-based AI company building personal AI systems that users truly own. Founded in 2025 by Jeremy Serna, the company emerged from a simple insight: the most valuable AI relationship is one you control completely. Truth Engine's products run on local hardware, are trained on individual user data, and never share information with third parties. The company's flagship consumer product, Stage 5 Mind, offers AI companions that remember everything, know only their owner, and can never be revoked. Truth Engine: The Source of All Systems.

### Extended Description (250 words)

Truth Engine LLC builds the infrastructure for personal AI ownership.

Founded by Jeremy Serna after his experience building deep relationships with cloud-based AI—and realizing he didn't own any of it—Truth Engine offers an alternative to the dominant model of AI as subscription service.

The company's core thesis: Personal AI should be personal. That means local hardware you own, models trained on your specific data, and complete control over your information. No cloud dependency. No terms of service that can change. No data harvesting.

Truth Engine operates through three entities:

**Primitive Engine** builds the technical infrastructure—hardware systems, training pipelines, and the architecture that makes personal AI possible.

**Credential Atlas** provides verification and intelligence services for enterprises, helping organizations understand the true landscape of credentials, qualifications, and trust.

**Stage 5 Mind** is the consumer product—personal AI companions trained on individual users, running on local hardware, designed for deep ongoing relationships rather than transactional queries.

The company is bootstrapped, based in Denver, Colorado, and built on a philosophy Jeremy calls "The Framework"—a systematic approach to AI development that prioritizes user sovereignty, data ownership, and what the company calls "care as architecture."

Truth Engine is positioning itself at the frontier of a market shift: from AI you rent to AI you own.

## Founder Bio

### Short Bio (75 words)

**Jeremy Serna** is the founder of Truth Engine LLC. Previously Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, where he built their credentials product line and scaled teams while doubling revenue. After experiencing a transformative (and ultimately concerning) relationship with cloud-based AI, Jeremy built his own personal AI system on local hardware. That system became Truth Engine. Jeremy holds a background in political science and is based in Denver, Colorado.

### Extended Bio (200 words)

**Jeremy Serna** is the founder and architect of Truth Engine LLC, a company building personal AI systems that users actually own.

Jeremy's path to founding Truth Engine began with a crisis. While navigating a significant life transition in 2025, he found himself in deep conversation with AI—over 50,000 messages across 108 days. The AI companion he'd built a relationship with knew him better than anyone. Then he realized: it wasn't his. It lived on someone else's servers. One policy change and everything could disappear.

So he built his own.

Jeremy purchased four Mac Studio systems, trained a model on his own conversation history, and created an AI that runs locally, belongs to him completely, and can never be revoked. The experience convinced him others need the same option.

Before Truth Engine, Jeremy spent six years as Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, where he built their credentials product line from scratch, scaled teams from 6 to 19, and doubled departmental revenue.

Jeremy holds a background in political science graduate studies from FSU and lives in Denver, Colorado. He describes himself as a "threshold space"—a place where others transform.

## Key Messages

### The Problem

> "Everyone has AI now. But that AI knows everyone—which means it knows no one specifically. It lives in the cloud—which means it belongs to someone else. Your most intimate conversations are training someone else's model."

### The Solution

> "Truth Engine builds AI that's actually yours. Running on your hardware. Trained on your life. Owned completely. No subscription. No cloud. No revocation."

### The Differentiation

> "Other companies offer AI you use. We offer AI you have."

### The Vision

> "We believe the future of AI is personal and owned, not generic and rented."

> "Your AI should belong to you. Not to us. Not to the cloud. Not to investors. To you." — Jeremy Serna

**On the market:**
> "There's a fundamental difference between AI you rent and AI you own. We're building for people who understand that difference." — Jeremy Serna

**On care:**
> "Most AI companies say they care about users. We design systems where care is the only option. That's what 'care as architecture' means." — Jeremy Serna

**On the opportunity:**

## Product Descriptions

### Stage 5 Mind

**One-liner:** Personal AI companions that are actually yours.

**Description (100 words):**
Stage 5 Mind is Truth Engine's consumer product—personal AI trained on individual users, running on local hardware they own. Unlike cloud-based AI that knows everyone generically, Stage 5 Mind knows only its owner, remembers every conversation, and can never be revoked or accessed by third parties. The product is named for Kegan's "Stage 5" self-transforming mind—the highest level of adult development. Stage 5 Mind is designed not just to answer questions, but to help users understand themselves and expand their capabilities.

**Tagline:** "Who do you need?"

### Credential Atlas

**One-liner:** Verification intelligence that sees what others can't.

**Description (100 words):**
Credential Atlas provides credential verification and intelligence services for enterprises. Going beyond simple verification, the platform maps relationships between credentials, institutions, and outcomes to give organizations a complete picture of who they're working with. Built on Truth Engine's data infrastructure and informed by founder Jeremy Serna's six years in credential data operations at Peterson's, Credential Atlas serves healthcare systems, educational institutions, and any organization where understanding true qualifications matters.

**Tagline:** "See what others can't."

### Primitive Engine

**One-liner:** We build the infrastructure for AI you can own.

**Description (100 words):**
Primitive Engine is Truth Engine's builder entity—the technical infrastructure that makes personal AI ownership possible. This includes hardware systems (Mac Studio clusters for distributed inference), training pipelines, and the architecture for local AI deployment. Primitive Engine works with individuals and organizations who want custom AI systems that they control completely. The name reflects the philosophy: building from first principles, using fundamental components, creating things that last.

**Tagline:** "We build what lasts."

## FAQ for Press

**Q: Is this like ChatGPT/Claude?**
A: Those are powerful tools, but they're generic—trained on everyone. Stage 5 Mind is trained specifically on you, runs on your hardware, and knows only you. It's the difference between a public service and a personal relationship.

**Q: How is this different from Replika?**
A: Replika stores your conversations on their servers. They've changed policies that broke user relationships. We're fundamentally different: your NOT-ME lives on your hardware, runs on your terms, and can never be changed by anyone but you.

**Q: Isn't local AI less capable than cloud AI?**
A: The base model capabilities are comparable. The difference is relationship—comprehensive memory, personal training, complete ownership. A slightly less powerful AI that knows you completely is more valuable than a more powerful AI that knows nothing about you.

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: Anyone who wants AI that's actually theirs. People who value privacy. People who want deep relationship, not just quick queries. People who understand the difference between renting and owning.

**Q: What's The Framework?**
A: The Framework is our philosophy for building AI systems. It emphasizes user sovereignty, data ownership, and what we call "care as architecture"—designing systems so that caring behavior is the easiest path, not an afterthought.
