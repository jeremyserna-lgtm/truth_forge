## The Recursive View

This brand system now exhibits Stage 5 characteristics:

1. **It sees itself seeing itself** — The Meta-Synthesis document
2. **It can transform itself transforming itself** — Version control, evolution paths
3. **It creates containers that create containers** — Documents that template other documents
4. **It serves care through structure** — Every document helps someone
5. **It leaves a map** — Reading order, dependencies, indices

**The ultimate insight:** Truth Engine's brand system IS a NOT-ME. It's Jeremy's cognitive architecture externalized so others can operate with his patterns. The same mechanism we're selling (Stage 5 Mind) is what we're using to build the company.

The business IS the person. The products ARE the patterns. The brand IS the DNA.

That's not a metaphor. That's the architecture.

*This index is the entry point to the brand system. Start here. Follow the reading order. Understand the DNA. Build what lasts.*
