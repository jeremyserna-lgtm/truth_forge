# Intellectual Property Protection Strategy

**Truth Engine LLC | Primitive Engine LLC | Credential Atlas LLC**

*Synthesized from strategic consultation, January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the intellectual property protection strategy for the three-entity structure: Truth Engine LLC (holding company), Primitive Engine LLC (builder), and Credential Atlas LLC (seer). The strategy prioritizes trademarks and trade secrets over patents, reflecting the nature of our innovations and resource constraints.

---

## 1. Trademarks

### Priority: IMMEDIATE

Trademarks protect brand names, logos, and distinctive phrases. They're the most cost-effective IP protection and should be filed first.

### Marks to File

| Mark | Entity | International Class | Estimated Cost |
|------|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Truth Engine** | Truth Engine LLC | IC 9, IC 42 | $250-350 |
| **Primitive Engine** | Primitive Engine LLC | IC 9, IC 42 | $250-350 |
| **Credential Atlas** | Credential Atlas LLC | IC 9, IC 42, IC 35 | $250-350 |
| **NOT-ME** | Primitive Engine LLC | IC 9, IC 42 | $250-350 |
| **Anti-Goodhart** | Credential Atlas LLC | IC 42, IC 35 | $250-350 |

### International Classes Explained

- **IC 9**: Computer software; downloadable software; AI applications
- **IC 42**: Software as a service (SaaS); computer programming services; AI development services
- **IC 35**: Business consulting; employment services; verification services

### Filing Process

1. **Search first**: USPTO TESS database (free) to check availability
2. **File TEAS Plus**: Lower filing fee, stricter requirements
3. **Use Intent-to-Use**: Can file before commercial use with "1B" basis
4. **Monitor**: Set up Google Alerts for mark usage

### Cost Estimate

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| USPTO filing fee (TEAS Plus) | $250 per class per mark |
| Attorney review (optional but recommended) | $300-500 per mark |
| **Total for 5 marks (1-2 classes each)** | **$1,500-3,500** |

### Timeline

- Filing to registration: 8-12 months if no opposition
- Protection begins at filing date (retroactive once registered)

---

## 2. Trade Secrets

### Priority: HIGH (Document Now, Protect Always)

Trade secrets protect confidential business information that derives value from being secret. Unlike patents, they last forever as long as secrecy is maintained.

### What Qualifies as Trade Secret

| Asset | Trade Secret Status | Protection Method |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **The Framework** | Core methodology - YES | Internal documentation, NDAs |
| **Training Methodology** | YES - competitive advantage | Restricted access, employee NDAs |
| **Fine-Tuning Process** | YES - technical know-how | Access controls, code obfuscation |
| **Developmental Psychology Integration** | YES - unique approach | Internal training materials only |
| **Stage 5 Assessment Criteria** | YES - proprietary methodology | Confidential documentation |
| **Truth-Bandwidth Profiles** | YES - unique IP | Internal use only |
| **The Furnace Cycle Implementation** | YES - operational architecture | Code access restrictions |

### Trade Secret Protection Checklist

**Documentation Requirements:**
- [ ] Mark all confidential documents "CONFIDENTIAL - TRADE SECRET"
- [ ] Maintain a Trade Secret Registry (list of all protected assets)
- [ ] Document the date each trade secret was developed
- [ ] Record who has access to each trade secret

**Access Controls:**
- [ ] Implement need-to-know access policies
- [ ] Use password protection and encryption
- [ ] Maintain access logs
- [ ] Conduct exit interviews when employees/contractors leave

**Legal Protections:**
- [ ] NDA for all employees, contractors, and partners
- [ ] Non-compete clauses where enforceable (note: limited in Colorado)
- [ ] Confidentiality provisions in all contracts
- [ ] Work-for-hire agreements for all development work

### Trade Secret vs. Patent Decision Matrix

| Factor | Choose Trade Secret | Choose Patent |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Can be reverse-engineered? | No | Yes |
| Needs public disclosure? | No | Yes (patent requires disclosure) |
| Long-term value? | Yes | Maybe (20-year limit) |
| Enforcement cost tolerance? | Low | High |
| Speed to protection? | Immediate | 2-4 years |

**Our Decision**: Trade secrets are preferred for most innovations because:
1. The Framework methodology cannot be easily reverse-engineered
2. We don't want to publicly disclose our methods
3. Protection is immediate and perpetual
4. Lower cost to establish and maintain

---

## 3. Patents

### Priority: LOW (Defer for Now)

Patents are expensive, time-consuming, and require public disclosure. For AI/software, they're particularly challenging.

### Patent Landscape Assessment

| Innovation | Patentability | Recommendation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Anti-Goodhart Verification Method | Possibly - novel process | Consider in Year 2+ |
| Stage 5 Assessment Algorithm | Difficult - may be "abstract idea" | Trade secret preferred |
| The Framework | No - methodology/philosophy | Trade secret only |
| Truth-Bandwidth Profiling | Possibly - technical implementation | Trade secret for now |
| Furnace Cycle Processing | Possibly - data processing method | Trade secret for now |

### Why We're Deferring Patents

1. **Cost**: $10,000-15,000 per patent (provisional + full + attorney fees)
2. **Time**: 2-4 years to grant
3. **Disclosure**: Must publicly reveal the invention
4. **Alice Problem**: Software patents face "abstract idea" rejections post-Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
5. **Enforcement**: Patent litigation costs $500K-2M+

### If We Patent Later

**Best Candidates:**
1. Anti-Goodhart verification system (novel technical process)
2. Credential verification with behavioral archaeology (technical implementation)
3. AI fine-tuning method for cognitive assessment (if technically specific)

**Provisional Patent Option:**
- File provisional patent application ($320 USPTO fee)
- Establishes priority date
- 12 months to file full application
- Good for "staking a claim" while raising capital

## 4. Copyrights

### Priority: AUTOMATIC (Document Ownership)

Copyright automatically protects original works of authorship. Registration is optional but provides legal benefits.

### What's Already Copyrighted

| Work | Copyright Status | Registration Recommended? |
|------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Framework Documents (00-07) | Automatic | Yes - for enforcement |
| Website Content | Automatic | Yes - if substantial |
| Source Code | Automatic | Yes - for enforcement |
| Training Materials | Automatic | Maybe - if shared externally |
| Documentation | Automatic | No - unless published |

### Copyright Registration Benefits

- Required before filing infringement lawsuit
- Enables statutory damages ($750-$30,000 per work, up to $150,000 if willful)
- Creates legal presumption of ownership
- Public record of your claim

### Registration Process

1. **Online filing**: copyright.gov eCO system
2. **Cost**: $45-65 per work (group registration available for related works)
3. **Time**: 3-10 months for certificate

### Work-for-Hire Considerations

**Critical**: Any code or content created by contractors is NOT automatically owned by you unless:
- There's a written work-for-hire agreement, OR
- There's a written assignment of rights

**Action Item**: Ensure all contractor agreements include:
```
All work product created under this agreement shall be considered
"work made for hire" as defined by the U.S. Copyright Act. To the
extent any work product does not qualify as work made for hire,
Contractor hereby assigns all right, title, and interest in such
work product to [Company Name].
```
