# Truth Engine Business Plan - Website Review

**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Purpose:** Review business plan to ensure only Truth Forge services appear on truth-forge.ai website  
**Status:** Issues Identified

---

## Executive Summary

The Truth Engine LLC business plan contains multiple references to services from **Primitive Engine LLC** and **Credential Atlas LLC** that should NOT appear on the Truth Forge website (truth-forge.ai).

**Truth Forge** is the source/origin entity - "ONE Source" - the underlying architecture/organism.  
**Truth Engine LLC** sells hardware + NOT-ME (THE PRODUCT).  
**Primitive Engine LLC** sells transformation services (THE SERVICE).  
**Credential Atlas LLC** sells verification/certification (THE OBSERVER).

---

## Issues Found

### 1. References to Primitive Engine Services

#### Issue 1.1: Line 103 - Summary Statement
**Location:** One-Sentence Summary  
**Text:** "Truth Engine sells the hardware and heartbeat. **Primitive Engine sells transformation.** The NOT-ME takes a year to know you."

**Action Required:** Remove reference to Primitive Engine. Focus only on Truth Engine/Truth Forge offerings.

---

#### Issue 1.2: Lines 135-137 - Ecosystem Table
**Location:** THE ECOSYSTEM section  
**Text:**
```
| **Primitive Engine** | Stage 5 as CODE | Architecture deployed into systems |
| **Credential Atlas** | Stage 5 as SEEING | Verification, certification, scoring |
```

**Action Required:** This section explains the ecosystem but should be reframed to show Truth Forge as the source, with Truth Engine as the product offering. Remove or reframe Primitive Engine and Credential Atlas references.

---

#### Issue 1.3: Lines 174-176 - What Jeremy Is Not
**Location:** WHAT THIS MEANS section  
**Text:**
```
| A coder | Code architecture (Primitive Engine) |
| An organizational consultant | The ability to see (Credential Atlas) |
```

**Action Required:** Remove references to Primitive Engine and Credential Atlas services.

---

#### Issue 1.4: Lines 190-192 - What All Three Entities Sell
**Location:** WHAT THIS MEANS section  
**Text:**
```
- **Truth Engine**: Here's how you coexist with your own AI (hardware + data + fine-tuned model)
- **Primitive Engine**: Here's how you build systems that coexist with AI
- **Credential Atlas**: Here's how organizations coexist with AI
```

**Action Required:** Remove Primitive Engine and Credential Atlas lines. Keep only Truth Engine/Truth Forge offering.

---

#### Issue 1.5: Lines 1449-1456 - Customer Routing
**Location:** Customer routing section  
**Text:**
```
| Hardware + AI (Soldiers, Kings, Empires) | **Truth Engine** |
| Stage Five architecture | **Primitive Engine** |
| Stage Five certification | **Credential Atlas** |

When someone says "I want more than hardware — I want you to transform how we think," that's a different conversation. That's Primitive Engine (builder) or Credential Atlas (seer).
```

**Action Required:** Remove routing to Primitive Engine and Credential Atlas. Truth Forge website should only route to Truth Engine offerings.

---

#### Issue 1.6: Lines 2783 - Transformation Services Mention
**Location:** THE CONVERGENT MODEL section  
**Text:** "And when they want more than hardware — when they want architecture, certification, transformation — we have that conversation too."

**Action Required:** Remove or reframe to focus only on Truth Engine hardware + NOT-ME offerings.

## Truth Forge Website Should Include

✅ **Hardware tiers** (Drummer, Soldier, King, Empire)  
✅ **NOT-ME offerings** (AI models on hardware)  
✅ **Heartbeat service** (optional cloud infrastructure)  
✅ **Optional annual service** (model updates, tuning)  
✅ **Truth Forge as source/origin** positioning  
✅ **Sovereign AI** messaging

❌ **Three-entity ecosystem explanation** (unless reframed as Truth Forge source)  

---

## Notes

- The business plan is comprehensive and well-structured for internal use
- For public-facing website, focus should be on Truth Forge/Truth Engine offerings only
- Other entities (Primitive Engine, Credential Atlas) should have their own websites/marketing
- Truth Forge website should position itself as "ONE Source" - the origin from which others derive
