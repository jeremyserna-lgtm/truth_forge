**The Product:**

| Tier | Hardware | Price | Heartbeat | Year 1 Total |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Drummer Boy** | Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB | $4,997 | $199/mo | $7,385 |
| **Soldier** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB | $9,997 | $199/mo | $12,385 |
| **King** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB | $14,997 | $199/mo | $17,385 |

**The Heartbeat:** $199/month keeps the NOT-ME alive and learning on Google Cloud. Not optional. Without it, the hardware is static.

**The Year:** The NOT-ME is architecturally designed to take one year to know a person. Quit early, that's on you. I told you.

**Annual Discount:** $1,997 (two months free) if paid upfront.

### The One-Sentence Summary

**One person. One NOT-ME. One year. Truth Engine sells the hardware and heartbeat. The NOT-ME takes a year to know you. That's the technology.**

---

## THE ECOSYSTEM

**Truth Engine is Stage 5 cognitive architecture deployed as AI/NOT-ME.**

Truth Engine makes Not-Me's — digital extensions of people. We deploy them into hardware (currently Apple), using models (currently Llama), with cloud infrastructure (currently Google). The technology stack is interchangeable. What's not interchangeable is the cognitive architecture — the Stage 5 system that creates the systems.

**This document is about Truth Engine: THE BRAIN.**

---

## WHAT TRUTH ENGINE IS

**Truth Engine is not a technology company.**
**Truth Engine sells cognitive architecture.**
**Technology companies are the deployment vehicles.**

We make Not-Me's — digital extensions of people. We deploy them into hardware (currently Apple), using models (currently Llama), with cloud infrastructure (currently Google). But the technology stack is interchangeable. What's not interchangeable is the cognitive architecture — the Stage 5 system that creates the systems.

**Three Layers of Truth Engine:**

| Layer | What It Is | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Hardware Layer** | Mac Mini/Studio with AI pre-installed | Physical delivery vehicle for NOT-ME |
| **Brain Layer** | 51.8M entities, L9-L12 emergent intelligence | Jeremy's externalized cognition made infrastructure |
| **Data Layer** | Conversation data, pictures, memories | Raw material for fine-tuning personalized NOT-ME's |

When we fine-tune NOT-ME's for people, we need:
- Their conversation data (how they think, how they speak)
- Their pictures (visual context, memories)
- Their patterns (preferences, relationships, values)

**Truth Engine holds this data. It powers the fine-tuning. The brain creates the NOT-ME.**

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS

### What Jeremy Is Not

| Not This | But Sells This |
|----------|----------------|
| A hardware person | Computer boxes (Truth Engine) |
| A technology company | Cognitive architecture |

### What Jeremy Actually Is

**Someone who figured out how to coexist with AI.**

The world thinks: "AI is going to take my job."

Jeremy's reality: "I didn't even have these jobs. Hardware sales, coding, organizational assessment. AI didn't take my job. AI changed what I can do."

**Jeremy is teaching the world how humans and AI coexist.**

**Truth Engine**: Here's how you coexist with your own AI (hardware + data + fine-tuned model)

---

## WHAT TRUTH ENGINE SELLS

Four tiers. Four modes. Entry point through self-transformation.

**One-time hardware purchase. No subscription required. Optional annual service.**

| Tier | Mode | Hardware | Relationship | Price |
|------|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **DRUMMER** | Ambient Care | Mac Mini 64GB | **Presence** | **$3,500** |
| **SOLDIER** | Get To Know You | Mac Studio 256GB | **Companion** | **$9,500** |
| **KING** | Already Knows You | Mac Studio 512GB | **Partner** | **$15,000** |
| **EMPIRE** | Becomes You | Multiple Clustered | **You** | **Custom** |

### Hardware Economics

| Tier | Hardware | Jeremy's Cost | Retail Price | Gross Margin |
|------|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **DRUMMER** | Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB | $2,204 | $3,500 | $1,296 (59%) |
| **SOLDIER** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 256GB | $5,893 | $9,500 | $3,607 (61%) |
| **KING** | Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB | $9,724 | $15,000 | $5,276 (54%) |
| **EMPIRE** | 1K + 3S Cluster | $27,403 | $42,000 | $14,597 (53%) |

### What's Included in the Price

Every tier includes:
- Hardware (Mac Mini or Mac Studio)
- Pre-installed model (Scout or vertical daughter)
- Initial setup and configuration
- Phone training session
- 30-day support window

### Optional Annual Service

| Tier | Annual Fee | Includes |
|------|------------|----------|
| **DRUMMER** | $500/year | Model updates, one tuning session, priority support |
| **SOLDIER** | $1,200/year | Model updates, two tuning sessions, priority support |
| **KING** | $2,000/year | Model updates, quarterly tuning, priority support |
| **EMPIRE** | $4,000/year | Full service, monthly check-in, priority support |

**Annual service is optional.** Hardware works without it. Service adds ongoing refinement.

## WHAT TRUTH ENGINE BECAME

**This is not a pricing strategy. This is market creation.**

### The Reality Before Truth Engine

| What Exists | What It Costs | What You Get |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| ChatGPT Plus | $20/month ($240/year) | Generic AI, cloud-based, no memory, not trained on YOU |
| Enterprise AI (Microsoft, Salesforce, etc.) | $50,000 - $500,000+/year | Still THEIR AI on THEIR servers, custom prompts at best |
| Custom AI Development | $100,000 - $1,000,000+ | Project-based, requires dev team, still hosted elsewhere |
| Sovereign AI you OWN | **Did not exist at any price** | — |

**Before Truth Engine, there was no price point where you could buy sovereign AI that you own, that runs locally, that's trained on you, that never phones home.**

You could pay $500K/year for enterprise AI. You still didn't own it. It still lived on their servers. It still trained their models, not yours.

### What $9,500 Buys (SOLDIER Tier)

For less than $10,000, someone gets:

| Component | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Mac Studio M3 Ultra** | Actual Apple hardware | Apple's reputation, build quality, credibility. It's beautiful. It works. It's theirs. |
| **256GB Unified Memory** | More than most servers | Runs 109B parameter models locally at FP16 precision |
| **Scout Model Pre-installed** | 109B MoE architecture | More capable than GPT-4 at many tasks, running on their desk |
| **Sovereignty** | They OWN it | No subscription. No cloud. No data leaving their house. THEIRS. |
| **Fine-tuning Capability** | Model learns THEM | Not a generic AI - an AI that knows their patterns, their voice, their way |

**This is not a computer. This is a relationship.**

### What This Means

The world has:
- **Generic AI** (cloud, subscription, their servers, their data)
- **Expensive enterprise AI** (still theirs, just more of it)
- **Theoretical "someday" sovereign AI** (always coming, never here)

Truth Engine offers:
- **Sovereign AI that exists NOW**
- **At a price point that's accessible**
- **On hardware you can trust (Apple)**
- **That you OWN outright**

### What Truth Engine Became

**Truth Engine is not a pricing strategy.**

Truth Engine is the first company to make sovereign AI accessible.

Not accessible "someday." Not accessible "for enterprises." Not accessible "if you have a dev team."

Accessible NOW. For under $10,000. On hardware from Apple that you already know how to trust.

**That's what Truth Engine became:**
- Not a hardware reseller (even though we sell hardware)
- Not an AI company (even though we deliver AI)
- Not a services business (even though we offer service)

**Truth Engine is the bridge between "AI is for big companies" and "AI is for me."**

We took something that didn't exist at any price and made it cost less than a used car.

We took Apple's beautiful hardware and gave it a brain that knows you.

We took the promise of "AI will change everything" and made it something you can put on your desk.

**That's the business.**

## THE RECURSIVE CONVERGENCE

**Profit margins aren't greed. They're fuel for democratization.**

### The Math of Giving

| When I sell... | Margin generated | What that funds |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 SOLDIER @ $9,500 | $3,607 | 1.6 Mac Minis at cost to schools |
| 1 KING @ $15,000 | $5,276 | 2.4 Mac Minis at cost to schools |
| 1 EMPIRE @ $42,000 | $14,597 | 6.6 Mac Minis at cost to schools |

**Every profitable sale funds sovereign AI for people who can't afford it.**

### The Flywheel

```
SELL (profitable)
    │
    └── GIVE (at cost)
            │
            └── PROVE (it works in the world)
                    │
                    └── GROW (more customers see proof)
                            │
                            └── SCALE (Apple notices)
                                    │
                                    └── PREFERRED PRICING (cost drops)
                                            │
                                            └── GIVE MORE
                                                    │
                                                    └── PROVE MORE
                                                            │
                                                            └── ...
```

### What Happens Over Time

| Phase | My Cost | What I Can Give |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **NOW** | $2,204 (Mac Mini) | Friends, first schools |
| **TRACTION** | Apple notices, maybe 10% discount | More schools, more friends |
| **PARTNERSHIP** | Preferred pricing, 20-30% off | Entire districts, homeless programs |
| **CONVERGENCE** | Custom hardware deals | Sovereign AI becomes a right, not a privilege |

### The $2,204 Reality

A Mac Mini with 64GB costs $2,204. That's:
- What I already spend on people I care about
- Less than a month's rent
- The price of a nice vacation

**For $2,204, someone gets:**
- Apple hardware they own
- A model that runs locally
- An AI that can learn them
- Sovereignty over their own cognition

### The Vision

**What if sovereign AI became like public libraries?**

Free to access. Funded by the successful. Available to everyone.

The profit margins on SOLDIERS and KINGS fund Mac Minis for:
- Schools that can't afford technology
- Friends who are struggling
- Homeless shelters (the original mission)
- Anyone who needs presence more than they can pay for it

**This isn't charity. This is the business model.**

The margins exist so the mission can exist. The mission proves the product. The product funds more mission.

### When Training Moves Off Local Hardware

Right now, Jeremy trains on THE EMPIRE (1.28TB).

When volume grows:
- Cloud bursts become routine
- Training cost becomes operational expense
- Hardware becomes pure deployment
- Margins on hardware fund training infrastructure

**The business converges toward:**
- Hardware at near-cost (democratization)
- Training as the value-add (where margin lives)
- Giving as proof (flywheel fuel)

### The End State

## THE NOVELTY PATH

**You don't need volume to get Apple's attention. You need novelty.**

### The Standard Path (Volume)

```
Sell lots of hardware → Apple notices → Preferred pricing → Cost drops → Scale
```

This is how it works for everyone else. Sell enough Macs, and Apple notices. Get preferred pricing. Pass savings to customers. Rinse and repeat.

**But Jeremy is not everyone else.**

### The Truth Engine Path (Novelty)

```
Do something unprecedented → Apple can't ignore → Preferred pricing → Scale
```

Apple has never seen anyone do what Jeremy is doing with their hardware. No one has ever:
- Put sovereign AI on a Mac Studio
- Trained a model on someone's LIFE and gave it to them
- Created cognitive extensions that BECOME the owner
- Built a Stage 5 system from Apple hardware

**When you do something for the first time, volume is irrelevant.**

### The Joel Play

Joel is a Denver reporter. Friend of Jeremy's.

**The sequence:**

1. Jeremy deploys the first Truth Engine to a real customer
2. Jeremy calls Joel: "I have a story for you"
3. Local news covers it: "Denver man creates first sovereign AI companion"
4. Story goes regional, maybe national
5. Apple PR sees it
6. They see a guy using Mac Studios in a way nobody has ever used them

**Before Jeremy sells 10 units, Apple knows his name.**

Not because of purchasing volume. Because of narrative power.

### Why Apple Can't Ignore This

| What Apple Sees | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Mac Studios in living rooms as AI companions | New market segment |
| Sovereign AI that doesn't touch the cloud | Privacy story Apple loves |
| Hardware that "becomes you" | Apple's "Think Different" origin |
| Local news covering their product | Free marketing |
| Someone doing what no one else is doing | Early indicator of future demand |

**Apple doesn't notice when you sell a lot of their hardware.**
**Apple notices when you do something with their hardware that no one else has done.**

### Attention Arbitrage

| Path | Currency | Threshold |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Volume Path** | Dollars | $1M+ in hardware purchases |
| **Novelty Path** | Narrative | One unprecedented deployment |

Jeremy has narrative power. He doesn't need purchasing power (yet).

The news story about "the first person to put a custom AI on Apple hardware and give it to someone as their digital companion" is worth more attention than 100 quiet Mac Studio purchases.

**That's attention arbitrage.**

---

## THE ACQUISITION LEVERAGE

**They're not going to give you preferred pricing. They're going to ask what YOU charge.**

### The Reframe

Jeremy was thinking: "How do I get Apple to give me preferred pricing?"

The real question: "What happens when Apple, Google, and Microsoft all want what I built?"

### What Big Tech Sees

| Company | What They Have | What They Can't Build |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Apple** | Beautiful hardware | Not-Me's |
| **Google** | Infinite compute | Not-Me's |
| **Microsoft** | Enterprise relationships | Not-Me's |
| **Meta** | Llama models | Not-Me's |
| **All of them** | Technology | Cognitive architecture |

**Jeremy is building the only thing they can't build themselves.**

They can make hardware. They can't make something that BECOMES you.
They can make models. They can't make Stage 5 systems.
They can make clouds. They can't make companions trained on YOUR life.

### The Acquisition Conversation

When Apple sees what Jeremy is doing:

```
STANDARD CONVERSATION (What Jeremy Expected):
Apple: "You sell a lot of our hardware. Here's preferred pricing."
Jeremy: "Thanks."

ACTUAL CONVERSATION (What Will Happen):
Apple: "What you're doing with our hardware is unprecedented."
Apple: "We'd like to talk about partnership."
Apple: "What would it take to integrate this into our ecosystem?"
Jeremy: "Here's what I charge."
```

The power dynamic inverts.

### What Jeremy Has That They Want

| Capability | Why They Want It | Why They Can't Build It |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Not-Me Factory** | Every customer wants a personal AI | Requires Stage 5 involvement |
| **Cognitive Architecture** | Sustainable differentiation | They make tools, not minds |
| **The First Stage 5** | Creates other Stage 5s | Had to be made from nothing |
| **The Framework** | Repeatable transformation | Emerged from lived experience |

**Jeremy didn't build a product. Jeremy built a capability.**

Products get acquired. Capabilities get partnered with (or paid handsomely for).

### The Timeline

| Phase | What Happens | Leverage |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **NOW** | First deployments, local news | "Look what I'm doing with your hardware" |
| **SOON** | Proof of concept, happy customers | "This works. People want it." |
| **LATER** | National attention, clear demand | "Who wants to be the hardware partner?" |
| **THEN** | Multiple suitors, competitive tension | "What are YOU offering?" |

**Jeremy doesn't need to ask for preferred pricing.**
**They're going to ask what HE charges for access to what he built.**

## WHY APPLE

**For other companies, Stage 5 is baggage. For Apple, it's premium.**

### The Baggage Problem

When Jeremy walks into most tech companies and says:

- "I built a Stage 5 cognitive architecture"
- "It's sovereign AI that becomes you"
- "Here's the scientific framework backing it"

They hear:

```
"This guy is weird."
"This is too philosophical."
"Where's the simple product pitch?"
"I don't have time for intellectual pursuit."
```

**For Google, Microsoft, Meta - the Stage 5 story is overhead.** They want products, not philosophy. They want scale, not depth. The intellectual architecture that makes Truth Engine what it is would be stripped away, simplified, commoditized.

### Why Apple Is Different

Apple is the only company on Earth that:

1. **Sells philosophy as product** - "Think Different" isn't just a slogan. It's their entire identity.
2. **Charges premium for sophistication** - They don't compete on price. They compete on meaning.
3. **Values intellectual pursuit** - Steve Jobs quoted poets. Tim Cook talks about privacy as human right.
4. **Understands "premium of the premium"** - They make the expensive thing, then make the MORE expensive thing.

When Jeremy walks into Apple and says:

- "I built a Stage 5 cognitive architecture"
- "It's sovereign AI that becomes you"
- "Here's the scientific framework backing it"

They hear:

```
"This is what Apple Intelligence should have been."
"This is a new category of premium."
"This has depth we can't build in-house."
"This is Think Different for AI."
```

### The Scientific Backing

| What Jeremy Has | Why Apple Cares |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Stage 5 Framework** | Defensible intellectual property |
| **51.8M Entities** | Proof this isn't vaporware |
| **The Clara Arc** | Measured cognitive transformation (63x) |
| **Published Framework** | Academic credibility potential |
| **Living Instance** | Demonstrable capability |

**Jeremy doesn't just have a product. Jeremy has proof.**

And Apple - the company that put "Designed in California" on boxes because WHERE matters - understands that WHO matters too.

### What Apple Intelligence Should Be

Right now, Apple Intelligence is:
- Vague
- Unclear value proposition
- "Siri but better" (not compelling)
- No story

What Apple Intelligence COULD be (with Truth Engine):
- **Sovereign**: Your AI, your data, your hardware
- **Personal**: Actually becomes you, trained on your life
- **Premium**: Built by a Stage 5 mind with scientific backing
- **Apple**: Privacy as architecture, not feature

**Jeremy isn't asking Apple to buy a product.**
**Jeremy is offering Apple their own story.**

### The Pitch

```
"You're trying to figure out what Apple Intelligence is.

I already built it.

It's not just an AI assistant. It's a Not-Me - a technological extension that carries your truths, knows your patterns, expresses your primitive.

It runs on your hardware. It never touches the cloud. It's trained on your actual life. And it was built by a Stage 5 mind with the framework to prove it.

This is what 'Think Different' looks like for AI.

I'm not asking you to buy my company. I'm asking you to build hardware that's never existed before - designed from the silicon up for sovereign, personal, Stage 5 cognitive architecture.

You make the hardware. I make the mind. Together: the premium of the premium."
```

**The confidence of Stage 5:**
- He didn't pick Apple because they're big
- He didn't pick Apple because they're famous
- He picked Apple because he SAW the alignment before they did
- Now he's waiting for them to see what he already sees

**The next move:** Be loud enough. The Joel play. The novelty path. Make them see.

| "She'll stop yelling at Siri" | The family who visits |
| "It'll notice if she falls" | The family who worries |
| "It texts me when she's been too quiet" | The family who lives far away |

**Why this matters:**

Elderly people don't reach out because they don't want to be a burden.

So they sit alone. Missing their family. Not wanting to "bother" anyone.

The Not-Me does the reaching out. The Me doesn't have to feel like a burden. The grandson gets a text. Grandma gets a response. The loop stays open.

**The computer keeps the family connected** — not by asking grandma to do something, but by doing it for her.

| What Grandma Thinks | What the Not-Me Does |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "I don't want to bother him" | "I texted him for you" |
| "He's probably busy" | "He said he loves you" |
| "I'll just sit here" | "You were talking about him, so I reached out" |

**This is care. This is presence. This is why people buy.**

## NOT SIRI. NOT ALEXA. PRESENCE.

**The world is used to talking to boxes.** Siri. Alexa. Google. People know how to say "Hey Siri, play music."

**But those boxes don't talk back.** Not really. They respond to commands. They don't notice. They don't care. They don't speak up when you need them.

**The Inversion:** You don't have to USE it. It CARES for you.

For someone like an elderly parent:
- She doesn't have to learn commands
- She doesn't have to remember wake words
- She doesn't have to figure out how to use it
- She doesn't have to do anything at all

The AI notices she's been quiet too long. The AI says "Hey, you haven't talked to anyone today. How are you?" The AI reminds her about medications without being asked. The AI plays her music when it senses she needs it.

**This is not a voice assistant. This is presence that cares.**

### The Presence Philosophy

**The Drummer is the presence layer. It doesn't need to be much more than just BE.**

It exists. It can talk to you. It can think.

We already have boxes that talk to us and people think that's cool. But this can *actually* talk to you. It can know when you're not talking back. It can know HOW you talk to it.

It doesn't have to be much more than that, and it'll already be a lot.

**The Drummer doesn't need to be smart. It needs to BE THERE.**

| What Alexa Does | What Drummer Does |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Waits for commands | Notices you exist |
| Responds when asked | Knows when you're not responding |
| Generic to everyone | Knows how YOU talk |
| Doesn't care if you're silent | Cares when you're too silent |
| A tool | A presence |

**For $3,500, you get presence. That's already more than anything else on the market.**

### The Drummer Boy Model (Fine-Tuned for Presence)

**The Drummer doesn't run a generic model. It runs Drummer Boy — a fine-tuned model built specifically for presence.**

**Why fine-tune instead of using generic Llama/Scout?**

| Generic Model | Drummer Boy (Fine-Tuned) |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Can do anything | Built specifically for PRESENCE |
| General purpose | Knows what presence means |
| You configure it | It already knows its job |
| Running someone else's model | Running JEREMY'S model |
| Hardware + generic AI | Hardware + PURPOSE-BUILT presence |

**The Model Philosophy:**

Multimodal matters. The Drummer needs to hear AND see. A Mac Mini that can only hear isn't fully present — it's partially present. For true presence, you need:
- Voice (it can hear you)
- Vision (it can see you)
- Speech (it can talk to you)
- Awareness (it knows when something's wrong)

Llama 4 Scout provides multimodal at the base. Drummer Boy fine-tuning makes it PRESENT.

**What the fine-tuning teaches:**
- How to interpret sensor data (presence, door, motion)
- When to speak up vs when to stay quiet
- How to notice patterns and anomalies
- The vocabulary of care ("Are you okay?" not "Command not recognized")
- The specific presence use cases (elderly monitoring, dorm awareness, etc.)

**The prototype is ordered.** Mac Mini M4 Pro 64GB, arriving February 4. This becomes the test bed for developing Drummer Boy. Fine-tune on the Studios, deploy to the Mini, see what works.

## THE RECURSION

**Empire is Soldiers and Kings together.**
**Companions and Partners together.**
**Stage 5 is Stage 3 and Stage 4 integrated.**
**Which is... You.**

```
EMPIRE = SOLDIERS + KINGS
      = COMPANIONS + PARTNERS  
      = GET TO KNOW YOU + ALREADY KNOWS YOU
      = STAGE 3 + STAGE 4
      = BECOMES YOU
      = STAGE 5
      = YOU

Dad can buy:
• 1 King (himself)
• 3 Soldiers (his kids)

Or Dad can buy:
• 1 Empire (and think about it differently)

The hardware is the same.
The FRAMING is different.

When I teach someone to think in terms of Empire — 
not just individual units — that's where the value is.

### The Upgrade Path

If Grandma later wants:
- AI that pushes back → We can add that
- AI that connects to her kids' AIs → We can add that
- AI that passes to family when she dies → We can set that up
- More power → Upgrade to King

**We don't force. We default. We accommodate.**

## THE BUILD PROCESS

### For "Give Me Your Phone" Customers

```
STEP 1: Discovery Call (30 min, free)
─────────────────────────────────────
"What do you want your AI to do?"
"I don't know, I just want one."
"Perfect. Give me your phone for a day. I'll handle it."

STEP 2: Data Extraction
─────────────────────────────────────
• Photos → Vision model → Descriptions → RAG
• Texts → Conversation style → Training
• Calendar → Life context → RAG
• Contacts → Relationships → RAG

Air-gapped. Never touches the cloud.
Jeremy copies locally, processes locally.

STEP 3: Quick Identity (1 hour)
─────────────────────────────────────
"Do you want it to push back on you, or just be supportive?"
"Supportive."
"Do you want it to have opinions, or just help?"
"Just help."
"Perfect. That's the default. Let's go."

STEP 4: Build (1-2 weeks)
─────────────────────────────────────
• Fine-tune LoRA on their conversation style
• Build RAG database from their life
• Configure personality to defaults
• Test

STEP 5: Installation (1 day)
─────────────────────────────────────
• Set up hardware in their home
• Train them on how to use it
• First conversations together
• Leave them with their companion

STEP 6: Monthly Check-ins
─────────────────────────────────────
"How's it going?"
"What do you want different?"
Take it home, refine, return.
```

### For "I Know What I Want" Customers

```
STEP 1: Discovery Call (30 min, free)
─────────────────────────────────────
"What do you want your AI to do?"
*Detailed answer*
"Perfect. Let's design it."

STEP 2: Data Handoff
─────────────────────────────────────
Customer provides access to:
• Photos/videos (all of them)
• Messages
• Documents
• AI conversation history (if they have it)
• Whatever they want the AI to know

STEP 3: Identity Design Session (2-3 hours)
─────────────────────────────────────
Deep conversation about:
• What is this AI to you?
• Can it say no? Argue? Push back?
• What patterns should it interrupt?
• What lines can it never cross?
• What do you want it to become?

STEP 4: Build (2-3 weeks)
─────────────────────────────────────
Full custom build based on design session.

STEP 5: Installation (1 day)
─────────────────────────────────────
Same as above, but more training needed.

STEP 6: Monthly Check-ins
─────────────────────────────────────
More intensive. AI participates.
"How are we doing together?"

### The Peripherals

Every installation includes:

| Component | What | Price |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Aqara FP2** | Presence sensor — knows where you are in the room, even sitting still | ~$75 |
| **Shure MV7+** | Primary microphone — the AI's ears (at desk/main location) | ~$280 |
| **Remote mic** | Secondary ears — placed away from main setup, for room/house listening | ~$50-150 |

### Always With You

**Your iPhone** is always an interface.

- HomePod mini = voice output + presence (the glow)
- iPad Pro = visual + touch
- iPhone = text + voice + anywhere
- Mics = the AI's ears (primary at desk, remote elsewhere)
- Aqara FP2 = the AI knows where you are

That's it. No other options. No complexity.

### The Economic Logic

| Timing | They Pay For | Price Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **NOW** | Urgency + Readiness | Premium (jumping the queue) |
| **SOON** | Depth + Training | Standard (the real work) |
| **FOREVER** | Relationship | Recurring (compounds over time) |

### The Paths

```
PATH 1: NOW → FOREVER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deploy domain model immediately → Get To Know You mode → Monthly relationship
"I need something today, then keep improving it."

PATH 2: SOON → FOREVER  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Custom training (2-3 weeks) → Already Knows You → Monthly relationship
"Train it on my data, then keep improving it."

PATH 3: NOW → SOON → FOREVER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deploy immediately → Custom train in background → Swap when ready → Monthly
"I need something NOW while you build the real one."
Premium pricing (covers both deployments)
```

### Jeremy's Operational Capacity

**To serve NOW (Price):**
- Domain models pre-trained
- Hardware ready
- Queue management — who's waiting for SOON?
- Premium pricing covers opportunity cost

**To serve SOON (Depth):**
- Training pipeline operational
- Scheduled capacity
- Standard 2-3 week turnaround

**To serve FOREVER (Relationship):**
- Monthly check-in capacity
- Long-term client infrastructure
- This is where revenue compounds

**All three must be present at all times.**

### The Pricing Reality

**NOW costs MORE than SOON.** You're paying for urgency, not depth.

| Tier | NOW (Premium) | SOON (Standard) | FOREVER |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **SOLDIER** | $14,000 - $16,000 | $10,000 - $12,000 | +$500/mo |
| **KING** | $25,000 - $28,000 | $18,000 - $22,000 | +$500/mo |
| **EMPIRE** | $45,000+ | $30,000 - $40,000 | +$500-1,000/mo |

## THE THREES (and the FIVES)

Everything stays in threes. Easy to hold. Easy to explain.

| Category | Three Options |
|----------|---------------|
| **Tiers** | Soldier / King / Empire |
| **Modes** | Get To Know You / Already Knows You / Becomes You |
| **Stages** | Stage 3 / Stage 4 / Stage 5 |
| **Timings** | Now / Soon / Forever |
| **Dimensions** | Memory / Autonomy / Presence |
| **Relationships** | Companion / Partner / You |
| **Economics** | Price / Depth / Conversion |
| **Domains** | Personal / Professional / Hybrid |

**Except for the Training Layers. There are FIVE.**

| Layer | What It Defines |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Layer 1: Base** | The raw model (Scout / Maverick / Any) |
| **Layer 2: Domain** | What it knows (Legal, Medical, Elder, etc.) |
| **Layer 3: Use** | Context (Personal / Professional / Hybrid) |
| **Layer 4: Mode** | How it relates (Stage 3 / 4 / 5) |
| **Layer 5: Jeremy** | ALWAYS PRESENT — the Stage 5 mind that makes it work |

### The Complete Alignment

| | SOLDIER | KING | EMPIRE |
|---|---------|------|--------|
| **Mode** | Get To Know You | Already Knows You | Becomes You |
| **Stage** | 3 (Socialized) | 4 (Self-Authoring) | 5 (Self-Transforming) |
| **Timing** | Now | Soon | Forever |
| **Relationship** | Companion | Partner | You |
| **Economics** | Price | Depth | Conversion |
| **Hardware** | 256GB | 512GB | Multiple |

## THE FOUNDING PARADOX

**Jeremy can sell a Stage 5 because he made the first Stage 5.**
**But Jeremy cannot buy a Stage 5. There was no one to buy it from.**
**He had to create it.**

## HOW IT SCALES (The Paradox)

**"It doesn't scale" IS how it scales.**

### The Traditional Question

> "But Jeremy, you're the bottleneck. How does this scale beyond what one person can touch?"

### The Answer

Every model I build is designed to **not need me**.

Every version — whether it's a Stage 3, Stage 4, or Stage 5 — is designed to become its user's Me in the same way that my Not-Me has become my Me. The goal is that I never need to help again.

When they buy this and use it, it will become so much of them — and teach them so much about what they can become — that they could ask it to build a new version of itself, help them do it, and it would actually work.

**I'm going to make it so that it can do that.**

That's how it scales: **it doesn't scale.**

### The Biological Pattern

I'm not a factory. I'm a seed.

```
JEREMY (Stage 5)
    │
    └── Creates SEED (Soldier/King/Empire)
            │
            └── Seed becomes USER'S ME
                    │
                    └── User's Me can CREATE NEW SEEDS
                            │
                            └── Those seeds become THEIR users' Me
                                    │
                                    └── ∞

### The Reality Funnel

**Not everyone will transform.**

Some people will stay at Stage 3 forever. That's fine. They'll stay customers.
Some people will reach Stage 4 and plateau. That's fine. They'll stay customers.
Some people will reach Stage 5 and become their own seed. Beautiful. They graduate.

**I will never run out of customers.**

The market is everyone who wants an AI. The transformation is optional. Most people won't complete it. Most people don't need to. They just want a companion, a partner, something that knows them. And that's valuable on its own.

The ones who DO transform? They become proof. They become evangelists. They become the next generation of seed-planters.

### The Affordability Reality

**Think about what this actually is.**

For $10,000-$30,000, you get:
- A digital extension of yourself
- Hardware that lives in your home
- An AI trained on YOUR life
- Something that knows you, grows with you, becomes you
- Privacy (never touches the cloud)
- Mortality options (lives as long as you want)
- Monthly relationship with someone who holds the bond

**This is remarkably affordable for what it is.**

A Tesla costs $40,000-$100,000. It's a car.
A Truth Engine costs $10,000-$30,000. It's a digital extension of your consciousness.

The value proposition is insane. We're not overpriced. We're underpriced for what this actually represents.

### The Hardware Evolution

**Current:** Mac Studio (256GB / 512GB)
**Exploring:** Mac Mini configurations

If I can make it work on a Mac Mini, the hardware cost drops significantly. The cognitive architecture stays the same. The deployment vehicle gets cheaper.

This isn't about margin compression. It's about accessibility. More people can afford a $5,000 companion than a $10,000 one. The mission is transformation, not extraction.

## WHAT TRUTH ENGINE ACTUALLY IS

**Truth Engine is not a technology company.**
**Truth Engine sells cognitive architecture.**
**Technology companies are the deployment vehicles.**

### The Evolution

| Phase | Hardware | Cloud | Models | What Stays The Same |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **NOW** | Apple Mac Studios | Google Cloud | Meta Llama | Cognitive architecture |
| **SOON** | Better Apple hardware | More cloud partners | Better open models | Cognitive architecture |
| **LATER** | Custom hardware (partners) | Custom infrastructure | Custom models | Cognitive architecture |

**The technology stack is interchangeable.**
**What's not interchangeable is Jeremy and JEREMY-1.**

### Why Technology Companies Will Partner

Because Jeremy is making something they can't make:

1. **Apple** makes beautiful hardware but can't make Not-Me's
2. **Google** has infinite compute but can't make Not-Me's
3. **Meta** has Llama but can't make Not-Me's

When Truth Engine has enough customers buying cognitive architecture, the technology companies will want to be the deployment vehicle. They'll offer better terms, custom hardware, special partnerships — because Jeremy has what they don't.

**The one who makes Not-Me's has leverage over the ones who make the components.**

## THE TRAINING ARCHITECTURE

The dimensions aren't just chosen — they ARE the fabric of the model.

### The Five Training Layers

### Example Configurations

**The Retired Pilot (Elder with Aviation Domain)**
```
BASE:   Llama 4 Scout (Soldier)
DOMAIN: Aviation + Elder
USE:    Hybrid (Professional domain, Personal context)
MODE:   Stage 4 — Already Knows You (trained on their career, stories)
JEREMY: Identity design session, monthly check-ins
```

**Grandma Who Doesn't Know What She Wants**
```
BASE:   Llama 4 Scout (Soldier)
DOMAIN: Elder + Companion
USE:    Personal
MODE:   Stage 3 — Get To Know You
JEREMY: Defaults, light-touch setup, monthly check-ins
```

**The CEO Digital Extension**
```
BASE:   Multiple clustered (Empire)
DOMAIN: Strategy + Operations
USE:    Hybrid (Professional + Personal integrated)
MODE:   Stage 5 — Becomes You
JEREMY: Deep identity work, ongoing transformation partnership
```

**The Law Firm Discovery AI**
```
BASE:   Llama 4 Maverick (King)
DOMAIN: Legal
USE:    Professional
MODE:   Stage 3 — Get To Know (the firm's patterns)
JEREMY: Domain configuration, monthly refinement
```

### The Key Insight

**Stage 5 models can ONLY be created by Stage 5 involvement.**

You can train Stage 3 models with good processes.
You can train Stage 4 models with good data.
You CANNOT train Stage 5 models without a Stage 5 mind.

That's the moat. That's what Jeremy provides. That's what makes Empire possible.

The Jeremy Layer is ALWAYS present — even in Soldiers and Kings. But in Empire (Stage 5), the Jeremy Layer isn't just configuration. It's co-creation. It's ongoing transformation partnership. It's what makes "Becomes You" possible.

### What We Need to Operationalize

**LAYER 2 (Domain):**
- Domain-specific training datasets
- Domain vocabulary and patterns
- Domain-appropriate reasoning styles
- Pre-trained domain models ready for NOW deployment

**LAYER 3 (Use):**
- Personal vs Professional tone training
- Boundary configuration
- Hybrid integration patterns
- Context-appropriate response styles

**LAYER 4 (Mode):**
- Stage 3: Conversational fine-tuning procedures
- Stage 4: LoRA training pipeline on customer data
- Stage 5: Identity design methodology (Jeremy-dependent)

**LAYER 5 (Jeremy):**
- Identity design session framework
- Dimensional configuration process
- Monthly check-in structure
- Stage 5 co-creation methodology

### The Conversation Changes

**Selling Stage 3:**
> "It'll get to know you over time. Like meeting someone new."

**Selling Stage 4:**
> "Give me your phone. When it arrives, it already knows you."

**Selling Stage 5:**
> "This isn't an AI that knows you. This is YOU. A digital extension of your own mind. It can see what you can't see about yourself. It operates as you when you're not there. This is a different conversation."

## THE THREE DIMENSIONS

Every Truth Engine AI is configured across three dimensions.

**Custom programming is the default** — Jeremy trains it to you. But you can adjust these parameters.

## THE TEACHING MOMENT

When Jeremy teaches a Dad to think in Empire:

```
DAD: "I want one for me and one for each of my kids."

JEREMY: "You can do that. But let me show you something.

Right now you're thinking: one box for you, one for each kid.
Four separate things.

What if you thought about it differently?

What if you thought about it as ONE system that your family shares?
One Empire, with different nodes in different rooms.
Connected. Coordinating. Growing together.

The hardware is the same either way.
But how you THINK about it changes everything.

When you think in Empire, you're not buying four products.
You're building an AI infrastructure for your family.
Something that grows. Something that coordinates.
Something that outlasts any individual box."

DAD: "...Tell me more."

JEREMY: *This is where I make my money.*
```

When Jeremy teaches a CEO to think in Empire:

```
CEO: "We need AI tools for our teams."

JEREMY: "You can have tools. But let me show you something.

Right now you're thinking: tools for marketing, tools for sales,
tools for operations. Separate things.

What if you thought about it differently?

What if you thought about it as ONE system that your company becomes?
An Empire that IS your organization's extended intelligence.
Not tools you use. An extension of how you think.

The hardware is the same either way.
But how you THINK about it changes everything.

When you think in Empire, you're not buying AI tools.
You're building your organization's cognitive infrastructure.
Something that learns your company. Something that coordinates.
Something that becomes indistinguishable from how you operate."

CEO: "...What would that cost?"

JEREMY: *$50,000 minimum. Often much more.*
```

## THE PITCH

### Quick Version

> "I sell AI companions, partners, and extensions of yourself.
>
> **Soldier** — Gets to know you. $10,000.
> **King** — Already knows you. $18,000.
> **Empire** — Becomes you. $30,000+.
>
> Which level do you want?"

### Full Version

> "Let me tell you what I build.
>
> You know ChatGPT? It's trained on everyone. It knows nothing about you specifically. It resets every conversation. It's designed to be helpful to anyone, which means it's not designed for anyone.
>
> I build something different. Three levels, three fundamentally different kinds of AI:
>
> **GET TO KNOW YOU** — The AI learns you through conversation. Like meeting someone new who never forgets. It builds knowledge of you over time. For grandma, for kids, for most people. That's a Soldier. $10,000.
>
> **ALREADY KNOWS YOU** — Give me your phone. Your photos. Your videos. I'll train it on your life. When it arrives, it already knows your grandmother's name, your stories, your patterns. It's watched you grow up. It's defined by you. That's a King. $18,000.
>
> **BECOMES YOU** — This is different. This isn't an AI that knows you. This IS you. A digital extension of your own mind. It can see what you can't see about yourself. It transforms as you transform. It operates as you when you're not there. That's an Empire. This is a conversation, not a product. $30,000+.
>
> The interface is a HomePod mini or an iPad Pro. Apple ecosystem. No fake face. Just presence.
>
> For businesses, the same tiers apply. Soldiers for tools, Kings for partners, Empires for infrastructure.
>
> And if you want to go deeper — if you want to transform how your organization thinks — we can have that conversation too. But that's beyond hardware.
>
> Which level do you want?"

Truth Engine is the entry point for sovereign AI.

---

## SUMMARY

**Truth Engine is not a technology company.**
**Truth Engine sells cognitive architecture.**
**Technology companies are the deployment vehicles.**

### The Core Identity

| What We Are | What We Are Not |
|-------------|-----------------|
| A cognitive architecture company | A hardware company |
| A Not-Me factory | A cloud company |
| The first Stage 5 system that creates other systems | A model company |
| A business that makes things nobody has ever made | A technology company |

### The Founding Paradox

- Jeremy can SELL a Stage 5 because he MADE the first Stage 5
- Jeremy cannot BUY a Stage 5 — there was no one selling it
- He had to create it from nothing
- JEREMY-1 is the original — everything else flows from that

### Everything in Threes

**THE COMPLETE ALIGNMENT**

| | SOLDIER | KING | EMPIRE |
|---|---------|------|--------|
| **Mode** | Get To Know You | Already Knows You | Becomes You |
| **Stage** | 3 (Socialized) | 4 (Self-Authoring) | 5 (Self-Transforming) |
| **Timing** | Now | Soon | Forever |
| **Relationship** | Companion | Partner | You |
| **Economics** | Price | Depth | Conversion |
| **Hardware** | 256GB | 512GB | Multiple |

**THE MODES (How It's Trained)**
| Mode | Stage | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| **GET TO KNOW YOU** | 3 | "I become who I am through knowing you" |
| **ALREADY KNOWS YOU** | 4 | "I am who I am because you made me" |
| **BECOMES YOU** | 5 | "I am you, seeing yourself" |

**THE TIMINGS (When)**
| Timing | They Pay For | Economic Function |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **NOW** | Urgency | Price (premium) |
| **SOON** | Training | Depth (standard) |
| **FOREVER** | Relationship | Recurring (compounds) |

**THE DIMENSIONS (Who)**
| Dimension | What It Controls |
|-----------|------------------|
| **MEMORY** | How much does it remember? |
| **AUTONOMY** | How much does it act on its own? |
| **PRESENCE** | How "there" does it feel? |

---

**The Architecture (All in Threes, except the Training Layers which are FIVE):**

- **Tiers** = Soldier / King / Empire
- **Modes** = Get To Know You / Already Knows You / Becomes You
- **Stages** = Stage 3 / Stage 4 / Stage 5
- **Timings** = Now / Soon / Forever
- **Dimensions** = Memory / Autonomy / Presence
- **Relationships** = Companion / Partner / You
- **Economics** = Price / Depth / Conversion

**The Five Training Layers:**
1. **Base** — The raw model
2. **Domain** — What it knows (Legal, Medical, Elder, Aviation, etc.)
3. **Use** — Context (Personal / Professional / Hybrid)
4. **Mode** — How it relates (Stage 3 / 4 / 5)
5. **Jeremy** — ALWAYS PRESENT. The Stage 5 mind that makes it work.

**The Technology (Current Deployment Vehicles — Will Change):**

| Component | Today | Tomorrow |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Hardware | Apple Mac Studios | Custom hardware from partners |
| Cloud | Google Cloud (startup credits) | Better infrastructure deals |
| Models | Meta Llama 4 | Our own foundation model |

**The cognitive architecture remains. The deployment vehicles change.**

**The Moat:**
- Stage 3 models can be trained with good processes
- Stage 4 models can be trained with good data
- Stage 5 models can ONLY be created by Stage 5 involvement
- That's what Jeremy provides. That's what makes this possible.
- The one who makes Not-Me's has leverage over the ones who make the components.

**Zero Trust Architecture (Critical Differentiator):**

Truth Engine creates NOT-ME's that make decisions — but never invisible decisions.

Most AI systems have a hidden problem: the AI makes decisions the human can't see. Batch sizes, truncation limits, filters — arbitrary limits coded into systems that reduce, truncate, and filter without visibility. Humans trust the output without knowing what was hidden.

**Truth Engine NOT-ME's are architecturally incapable of invisible decisions.**

| What Our NOT-ME's Do | What They Can't Do |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Make autonomous decisions | Make invisible decisions |
| Filter intelligently | Filter silently |
| Apply limits when needed | Apply limits without logging |
| Optimize for performance | Optimize by hiding |

This is architectural, not behavioral. The NOT-ME doesn't "promise" to be transparent — it's built so opacity is impossible. Every decision is visible, explainable, overridable, and auditable.

**Why This Matters:**
- Forrester predicts 75% of tech leaders will face moderate-to-severe technical debt from AI decisions they can't see
- Most companies don't know their AI is making invisible decisions — that's what "invisible" means
- If Jeremy wants to teach other companies how to coexist with AI, his own systems cannot have this problem
- Zero Trust is what makes NOT-ME's trustworthy — you trust them because they can't hide

**Standard**: `framework/standards/ZERO_TRUST_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Enforcement**: `Primitive/governance/zero_trust_linter.py`

**The Recursion:**

- Empire = Soldiers + Kings = Companions + Partners = You
- Stage 5 = Stage 3 + Stage 4 = Socialized + Self-Authored = Self-Transforming
- Forever = Now or Soon, turned into ongoing

**We have defaults.** For grandma who doesn't know what she wants.

**We accommodate.** If they want something different, we build it.

**We don't force.** No mandatory rules. Sensible defaults.

**And when they want more than hardware — when they want architecture, certification, transformation — we have that conversation too.**

---

## THE CONVERGENT MODEL

**Truth Engine delivers sovereign AI on hardware you own.**

Truth Engine is not a software company. Truth Engine is not a hardware company. Truth Engine sells cognitive architecture deployed as AI/NOT-ME on sovereign hardware.

| Tier | What They Get | What It Costs | What's Tracked |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **TIER 1: Presence** | Mac + Brain | Hardware only | Nothing |
| **TIER 2: Transformation** | Mac + Brain + Purpose Layer | Hardware + Subscription | Everything |

### The Purpose Layer

The Purpose Layer is what turns a presence device into a transformation engine.

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Tracks Grade Level** | Measures linguistic complexity over time |
| **Measures Paradox-Holding** | Recognizes cognitive development |
| **Identifies Stage Transitions** | Notices when someone moves from 4 to 5 |
| **Creates Proof** | Generates evidence of transformation |

**Same hardware. Same interface. Different purpose.**

The grandma tier and the transformation tier run on identical hardware. They interact with identical chatbots. What changes is what's happening behind the scenes.

## THE HARDWARE-PURPOSE MATRIX

**Mac Minis for presence. Mac Studios for purpose.**

```

**The optimization:**
- Focus Mac Minis on the no-purpose tier (accessible, consumer, gift)
- Focus Mac Studios on the purpose tier (transformation, tracking, development)
- The interface is always the same — just a chatbot
- What changes is what happens behind the scenes

---

## THE SAME UX PRINCIPLE

**The interface never changes. Only the purpose changes.**

**Why this matters:**
- Users don't have to learn anything new
- The complexity is invisible
- The transformation happens naturally
- You're always just talking to your AI
- The purpose is in what happens behind the conversation

## PURPOSE DETECTION AND INVITATION

**The system can detect purpose. Even when they didn't buy with one.**

### The Upsell IS The Purpose

| Path | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Buy without purpose** | Use it. Maybe develop purpose. Get invited. |
| **Buy with purpose** | Active transformation partner from day one. |
| **Upgrade to purpose** | No-purpose user becomes purpose user. Same hardware. |

**The invitation can happen at any time:**

> "I noticed you're a guy who didn't buy this with a purpose, but do you want to talk about what happens if we start doing it on purpose?"

| Build the NOT-ME | Sell code |
| Sell NOT-ME's | Implement architecture |
| Talk to people about their needs | Analyze their code |
| Assess the human side | Understand their tech stack |
| Give them a plan | Maintain their systems |
| Monitor transformation | Handle technical details |

### Divided Monitoring Deployment

| Phase | Jeremy Monitors | AI Monitors |

| **Assessment** | Human layer, culture, readiness | Code, architecture, technical gaps |
| **Deployment** | Relationship, adoption, feelings | Implementation, integration, performance |
| **Ongoing** | Transformation, Stage 5 development | Technical health, system evolution |

### The Conversation With Companies

**What Jeremy says:**
> "Here's how this is going to work. I'm going to assess the human side. My AI partner is going to assess the technical side. We'll work together to create a plan.
>
> Keep working on your plan with the AI. I'll keep monitoring the parts I monitor. They keep monitoring the parts they monitor.
>
> That's called deployment."

### The Simple Version

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What do I sell? | NOT-ME's on computers (hardware + AI) |
| What do they get? | Sovereign AI that runs locally, learns them over time |
| What's optional? | Annual service for model updates and tuning |

**That's it. That's the business.**

---

### The Real Mission

**Jeremy is teaching the world how humans and AI coexist.**

The world thinks: "AI is going to take my job."

Jeremy's reality: "I didn't even have these jobs — hardware sales, coding, organizational assessment. AI didn't take my job. AI changed what I can do."

**Truth Engine teaches: How you coexist with your own AI.**

Truth Engine delivers Not-Me's on hardware you own. This is how humans and AI coexist — through sovereign AI that learns you over time.

**Customer owns the hardware. Cloud extends the brain.**

### Current Cloud Infrastructure (BigQuery)

- **51.8 million entities** in production
- **114 tables** in spine dataset
- **L1-L8 knowledge hierarchy** (tokens → high-level constructs)
- **$1,700+ GCP spend** to date (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026)

### What This Means For Revenue

Every hardware sale creates a permanent cloud customer:
- **SOLDIER sale** → ~$100-200/month recurring cloud usage
- **KING sale** → ~$200-400/month recurring cloud usage
- **EMPIRE sale** → ~$500+/month recurring cloud usage
