## POSITIONING FOR GOOGLE STARTUP PROGRAM

### The Story Google Needs to Hear

**Not this:** "I'm a consultant who builds systems for founders"

**This:** "Primitive Engine builds personalized AI infrastructure. We're proving the methodology through high-touch services while developing the platform. The founder built data infrastructure at scale (Peterson's, 51.8M entities) and now applies that to human-AI collaboration."

### What Makes This a Startup (Not Just Services)

| Element | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Technology** | Truth Engine, Framework architecture, AI orchestration methodology |
| **Data Asset** | Knowledge graphs, conversation processing, pattern extraction |
| **Methodology** | The Seeing → Pilot → Stewardship (repeatable, systematized) |
| **Product Vision** | "Primitive" — personalized AI extensions |
| **Founder Credibility** | 6 years building data infrastructure at Peterson's |
| **Market** | Every founder/leader drowning in AI tools that don't fit them |

## PAGE 1: HOMEPAGE

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
> "Everyone else has AI. You have you."

**Subheadline:**
> "Primitive Engine builds personalized AI infrastructure that extends your capability—not generic tools that require you to adapt to them."

**CTA:**
> [Start a Conversation]

---

### Section 2: The Problem

**Header:**
> "AI tools are everywhere. Most of them don't fit."

**Body:**
> You've tried the chatbots. The automations. The "AI assistants." They work—sort of. But they require you to think like them, not the other way around.
>
> The problem isn't AI. The problem is that AI isn't built for *you*.
>
> Your patterns. Your context. Your way of thinking.
>
> We build AI infrastructure that learns your architecture—then extends it.

---

### Section 3: The Vision

**Header:**
> "Personalized AI infrastructure"

**Body:**
> Primitive Engine creates systems that:
>
> - **See what you see** — Your patterns, your priorities, your blind spots
> - **Hold what you hold** — Your context, your history, your relationships
> - **Move how you move** — Your workflows, your decisions, your rhythm
>
> Not another tool to learn. An extension of how you already think.

---

### Section 4: Current Offerings

**Header:**
> "How we work today"

**Subheader:**
> "We're proving the methodology through high-touch engagements while building the platform."

**Card 1: The Seeing** — $300
> 90 minutes. I map your architecture—how you think, what you're building, where you're stuck. You leave with clarity on what to build first.

**Card 2: The Pilot** — $3,000
> One week. I build one mechanism that proves the concept. You get infrastructure that works.

**Card 3: The Stewardship** — $5,000/month
> Ongoing. I maintain, evolve, and protect what we built. Your systems keep breathing.

**CTA:**
> [Book The Seeing →]

### Section 5: Founder

**Header:**
> "Built by someone who's done this before"

**Photo:** Professional headshot

**Body:**
> I'm Jeremy Serna. I spent six years as Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, where I built their credential data infrastructure from nothing—51.8 million entities, team scaled from 6 to 19 people, revenue doubled.
>
> Now I build personalized AI infrastructure. Same discipline. Different domain.
>
> I think in systems. I build things that last.

**Credentials (subtle):**
> Former Director of Data Operations, Peterson's | Denver, CO

---

### Section 6: CTA

**Header:**
> "Let's talk about what you're building"

**Body:**
> No pitch deck. No pressure. Just a conversation about your architecture and what might be possible.

**Button:**
> [Schedule a Call]

### Hero

**Headline:**
> "I build systems that hold weight."

**Photo:** Professional headshot

### Section 1: The Short Story

> I spent six years at Peterson's building data infrastructure from scratch. Director of Data Operations. Scaled the team from 6 to 19 people. Built a credential product line that doubled departmental revenue. Created a 51.8 million entity knowledge graph.
>
> I left to build something different.
>
> Primitive Engine is the result: personalized AI infrastructure that extends human capability instead of replacing it.

---

### Section 2: What I Believe

> **Systems should serve you, not the other way around.**
> If you're adapting to your tools every day, they're not your tools. They're your constraints.
>
> **AI without personalization is noise.**
> Generic chatbots give generic answers. Your thinking deserves infrastructure built for your patterns.
>
> **Infrastructure is care.**
> Building something that lasts—that works whether you wake up motivated or not—is an act of care for the people who depend on it.

---

### Section 3: Background

> - Director of Data Operations at Peterson's (2019-2024)
> - Built credential data products used across the education sector
> - Political Science graduate studies, Florida State University
> - U.S. Military veteran
> - Based in Denver, Colorado

## PAGE 3: APPROACH / HOW IT WORKS

### Hero

**Headline:**
> "How we build personalized AI infrastructure"

---

### Section 1: The Philosophy

> Most AI implementations fail because they start with the tool, not the person.
>
> We start by understanding your architecture—how you think, what you're building, where the friction lives. Then we build infrastructure that fits.
>
> The result: systems that extend your capability instead of requiring you to adapt to them.

---

### Section 2: The Process

**Step 1: See**
> We map your architecture. Your patterns. Your bottlenecks. What you're trying to build and what's in the way.
>
> This is The Seeing—a 90-minute session where I show you what I see.

**Step 2: Build**
> We create one mechanism that proves the concept. Not a grand plan. One thing that works.
>
> This is The Pilot—one week, one deliverable, proof of concept.

**Step 3: Sustain**
> We maintain, evolve, and protect what we built. Your systems keep breathing without you pushing them every day.
>
> This is The Stewardship—ongoing partnership.

---

### Section 3: The Technology

> **Truth Engine** — Our core infrastructure for processing, structuring, and operationalizing knowledge
>
> **The Framework** — A systematic approach to building systems that metabolize complexity
>
> **AI Orchestration** — Methodology for human-AI collaboration that keeps humans in the loop and AI in its lane

## FOR GOOGLE STARTUP PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY

### What They'll Look For

1. **Is this a real company?** → Yes, Primitive Engine LLC, formed Jan 2026, EIN, bank accounts
2. **Is there technology?** → Yes, Truth Engine, Framework, AI orchestration methodology
3. **Is there a product vision?** → Yes, "Primitive" — personalized AI infrastructure
4. **Is the founder credible?** → Yes, 6 years Peterson's, Director level, built at scale
5. **Could Google Cloud help?** → Yes, infrastructure needs for knowledge graphs, processing

### Talking Points for Ashutosh

> "Primitive Engine builds personalized AI infrastructure. We're currently validating the methodology through high-touch services—The Seeing, The Pilot, The Stewardship—while developing the platform.
>
> My background is six years at Peterson's as Director of Data Operations, where I built credential data infrastructure at scale—51.8 million entities.
>
> The vision is AI that extends individual capability instead of forcing everyone into the same generic tools. We call it 'Primitive'—everyone else has AI, you have you.
>
> Google Cloud would help us scale the infrastructure layer—knowledge graphs, processing pipelines, the backend that makes personalization possible."
