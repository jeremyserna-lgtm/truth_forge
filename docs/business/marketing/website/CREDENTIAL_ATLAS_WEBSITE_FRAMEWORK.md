## POSITIONING

### The One-Liner
> "Credential Atlas connects your credential data to institutional context and labor market outcomes."

### The Problem You Solve
EdTech companies and workforce boards sit on mountains of credential data—but it's disconnected. They can't prove ROI because they can't connect credentials to outcomes.

### The Solution
A 51.8 million entity knowledge graph that enriches your credential data with institutional context, accreditation status, and labor market outcomes.

### Why You (Competitive Advantage)
- Built by someone who did this at Peterson's for 6 years
- Operational knowledge graph (not vaporware)
- 4-week delivery (not 6-month implementation)
- BigQuery or API—your choice

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
> "Your credential data, finally making sense."

**Subheadline:**
> "Credential Atlas connects your data to 51.8 million institutions, programs, and outcomes. Four weeks. One dataset. Done."

**CTA:**
> [Request a Demo]

---

### Section 2: The Problem

**Header:**
> "Sound familiar?"

**Pain Points:**
- "Your credential data exists in 47 spreadsheets and nobody trusts any of them"
- "You can't prove ROI because you can't connect credentials to outcomes"
- "Every report requires a data scientist and three weeks"
- "Your state workforce board is asking questions you can't answer"

**Transition:**
> "You don't have a data problem. You have a context problem. Credentials mean nothing until they're connected to institutions, accreditation, and labor markets."

---

**Header:**
> "Credential intelligence in four weeks"

**What You Get:**

**Card 1: Enriched Data**
> Your credential records connected to institutional context—accreditation status, program details, completion rates, employer recognition.

**Card 2: Labor Market Connection**
> Link credentials to actual outcomes—employment, wages, career pathways. Prove ROI with real data.

**Card 3: Analysis-Ready**
> BigQuery access or API integration. Your team can query immediately. No data science required.

## PAGE 3: USE CASES

### Hero

**Headline:**
> "Who uses Credential Atlas"

---

### Use Case 1: EdTech Companies

**The Challenge:**
> You have millions of credential records from learners. But you can't tell customers what those credentials are worth because your data isn't connected to outcomes.

**The Solution:**
> Credential Atlas connects your learner data to institutional context and labor market outcomes. Now you can show customers the ROI of credentials earned on your platform.

**Example:**
> "Learners who earned [credential] at [institution] saw a 23% wage increase within 2 years."

---

### Use Case 2: State Workforce Boards

**The Challenge:**
> The legislature wants to know which training programs lead to jobs. You have enrollment data and employment data, but they don't connect.

**The Solution:**
> Credential Atlas links training program completions to employment outcomes. Answer policy questions with real data instead of estimates.

**Example:**
> "Programs at accredited institutions show 34% higher employment rates than non-accredited alternatives."

---

### Use Case 3: Higher Education Institutions

**The Challenge:**
> You need to understand how your programs compare to peers and connect to labor markets. But your institutional research team is drowning in manual analysis.

**The Solution:**
> Credential Atlas provides benchmarking data and labor market connections. Understand your position and identify opportunities.

**Example:**
> "Your nursing program completers earn 12% above regional median within 1 year."

### Section 1: The Story

> Credential Atlas exists because I spent six years watching credential data problems up close.
>
> As Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, I built their credential data infrastructure from nothing. I scaled the team from 6 to 19 people. I created the products that power credential intelligence across the education sector.
>
> I saw the same problem everywhere: organizations sitting on credential data they couldn't use because it wasn't connected to anything meaningful.
>
> Credential Atlas fixes that. Four weeks. One dataset. Done.
