**Purpose:** Professional website ready for Google call and all prospect research
**Timeline:** Can implement in 2-3 hours

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your website needs to answer three questions within 5 seconds:
1. **What do you do?** → Build data infrastructure and operational systems
2. **Who do you help?** → EdTech companies, workforce boards, and people whose businesses outgrew their systems
3. **What's the outcome?** → Data that makes sense, systems that breathe

## PAGE 1: HOMEPAGE

### Hero Section (Above the Fold)

**Headline (8-12 words):**
> "I build data infrastructure and systems that hold weight."

**Subheadline (15-25 words):**
> "For EdTech companies that need their credential data to make sense. For leaders whose operations outgrew their spreadsheets."

**CTA Button:**
> [Schedule a Conversation]

---

### Section 2: What I Do (The Offerings)

**Section Header:**
> "Two ways I can help"

**Card 1: Credential Atlas**
> **For EdTech & Workforce**
>
> Your credential data connected to institutional context and labor market outcomes.
> Turn messy data into intelligence that proves ROI.
>
> [Learn More →]

**Card 2: The Services**
> **For Leaders & Founders**
>
> I build systems that breathe on their own. Start with a 90-minute session
> where I map your architecture. If there's something to build, I build it.
>
> [Learn More →]

### Section 3: The Problem I Solve

**Header:**
> "Sound familiar?"

**Pain Points (3-4 bullet points or cards):**

- "Your credential data exists in 47 spreadsheets and nobody trusts any of them"
- "You're the bottleneck because your business outgrew your systems"
- "You built something that works, but it requires you to push it every day"
- "You know you need infrastructure, but you don't know where to start"

**Transition:**
> "I spent six years at Peterson's building credential data infrastructure from scratch. Now I help others do the same—faster."

---

### Section 4: Credibility Markers

**Header:**
> "Background"

**Key Points:**
- Former Director of Data Operations at Peterson's
- Built credential product line from zero to multi-million dollar revenue
- Scaled data team from 6 to 19 people
- 51.8 million entity knowledge graph (operational)
- Political Science graduate work, Military veteran

---

### Section 5: How It Works

**Header:**
> "Simple process"

**Step 1:**
> **Conversation**
> We talk. I listen. I ask questions. You tell me what's broken.

**Step 2:**
> **Proposal**
> I tell you what I see and what I'd build. Clear scope, clear price, clear timeline.

**Step 3:**
> **Build**
> I build it. You get infrastructure that works whether you wake up motivated or not.

---

### Section 6: CTA

**Header:**
> "Ready to talk?"

**Subtext:**
> "No pitch deck. No pressure. Just a conversation about what you're dealing with."

**Button:**
> [Schedule a 30-Minute Call]

### Credential Atlas Section

**Tagline:**
> "Your credential data, finally making sense."

**The Problem:**
> EdTech companies and workforce boards sit on mountains of credential data—but it's disconnected from context. You can't prove ROI because you can't connect credentials to outcomes.

**The Solution:**
> Credential Atlas connects your credential data to institutional context (51.8M entities) and labor market outcomes. Four weeks. One dataset. Done.

**What You Get:**
- Enriched credential data connected to institutions, accreditation, and outcomes
- BigQuery access or API integration
- Documentation your team can actually use
- Ongoing support options available

**Investment:**
> Projects start at $15,000 | 4-week delivery
>
> [Let's Talk About Your Data →]

---

### The Services Section

**Tagline:**
> "Systems that breathe."

**The Problem:**
> You built something that works. But it only works if you push it. You're the engine, the bottleneck, the single point of failure.

**The Solution:**
> I build operational infrastructure that runs whether you wake up motivated or not. Not advice. Not coaching. Infrastructure.

**How It Works:**

**The Seeing** — $300
> 90 minutes. I map your architecture. I show you what I see. You leave with clarity on what to build first.

**The Pilot** — $3,000
> One week. I build one mechanism that proves the concept. You get something that works.

**The Stewardship** — $5,000/month
> Ongoing. I maintain, evolve, and protect what we built. Up to 10 hours of work per month.

**CTA:**
> [Book The Seeing →]

## PAGE 3: ABOUT

### The Short Version

> I spent six years at Peterson's as Director of Data Operations, where I built their credential data product line from nothing. I scaled the team from 6 to 19 people and doubled departmental revenue.
>
> Now I help EdTech companies and workforce boards make sense of their credential data—and I help founders build systems that don't require them to push every day.
>
> I live in Denver. I think in systems. I build things that last.

### What I Believe

> - **Systems should serve you, not the other way around.** If you're pushing your business every day, you don't have a system. You have a treadmill.
>
> - **Data without context is noise.** Credential data means nothing until it's connected to institutions, outcomes, and decisions.
>
> - **Infrastructure is care.** Building something that lasts is an act of care for the people who will use it.

## MINIMUM VIABLE WEBSITE (2-Hour Version)

If you only have 2 hours before your Google call, build ONE strong homepage:

1. **Hero:** Headline + Subheadline + CTA button
2. **What I Do:** Two cards (Credential Atlas / The Services)
3. **Background:** Short bio (3-4 sentences) + key credibility points
4. **How It Works:** Three simple steps
5. **Contact:** Email + "Schedule a call" link

**A strong homepage is better than five weak pages.**

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

1. **Don't try to appeal to everyone** — Be specific about who you help
2. **Don't hide your prices** — At minimum, give ranges
3. **Don't use jargon** — "Data that makes sense" beats "credential intelligence"
4. **Don't make people hunt for contact info** — CTA on every page
5. **Don't over-explain** — You can elaborate on a call
6. **Don't use stock photos of handshakes** — Your face or nothing
7. **Don't launch "perfect"** — Launch functional, improve over time

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**What Google (or any prospect) needs to see in 10 seconds:**

1. ✅ This person builds data infrastructure
2. ✅ They have real experience (Peterson's, 6 years, scaled teams)
3. ✅ They can help EdTech/data companies
4. ✅ There's a clear way to start a conversation

**Everything else is optimization.**
