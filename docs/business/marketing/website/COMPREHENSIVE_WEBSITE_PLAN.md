# Comprehensive Website Plan for Truth Forge
## Encapsulating All Depth and Breadth of the Business

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Purpose:** Complete website architecture that reflects the full scope of Truth Forge, Primitive Engine, Credential Atlas, and the underlying framework

---

## Executive Summary

The Truth Forge website must serve multiple audiences while maintaining a unified brand identity:

1. **B2C Consumers** - Seeking personal AI (NOT-ME) products
2. **B2B Services** - Primitive Engine consulting and infrastructure
3. **B2B Enterprise** - Credential Atlas data intelligence
4. **Researchers/Thinkers** - Framework philosophy, white papers, theory
5. **Partners/Investors** - Business architecture, strategy, vision

The current website focuses primarily on the NOT-ME consumer product. This plan expands it to encompass the full business ecosystem.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Pages
- ✅ Home - NOT-ME focused, consumer-oriented
- ✅ What is Not-Me - Product explanation
- ✅ Vision - Custom LLMs, personal AI

- ✅ Privacy Deployments - Privacy-first positioning
- ✅ Pre-Order - Consumer product sales
- ✅ About - Three-entity structure (Truth Engine, Primitive Engine, Credential Atlas)
- ✅ Meet Not-Me - Personified AI introduction

### Gaps Identified
1. **Missing B2B Services Pages** - Primitive Engine offerings (The Seeing, Builds, Stewardship)
2. **Missing Enterprise Product** - Credential Atlas positioning and capabilities
3. **Missing Resources Section** - White papers, theory documents, framework documentation
4. **Missing Business Strategy** - For partners/investors
5. **Missing Case Studies** - Real-world applications
6. **Missing Technical Documentation** - For developers/technical buyers
7. **Incomplete Entity Clarity** - Three entities need dedicated sections
