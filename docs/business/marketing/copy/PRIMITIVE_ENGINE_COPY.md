## HOMEPAGE

### Hero Section

**HEADLINE:**
Everyone else has AI. You have you.

**SUBHEADLINE:**
Primitive Engine builds personalized AI infrastructure that extends your capability—not generic tools that require you to adapt to them.

**BUTTON TEXT:**

### Section: The Problem (StoryBrand: Character + Problem)

**SECTION HEADER:**
AI tools are everywhere. Most of them don't fit.

**BODY TEXT:**
You've tried the chatbots. The automations. The "AI assistants."

They work—sort of. But they require you to think like them, not the other way around.

The problem isn't AI. The problem is that AI isn't built for you. Your patterns. Your context. Your way of thinking.

**What if AI adapted to you instead of you adapting to it?**

We build AI infrastructure that learns your architecture—then extends it.

---

### Section: What We Build

**SECTION HEADER:**
Personalized AI infrastructure

**SECTION SUBHEADER:**
Not another tool to learn. An extension of how you already think.

**CARD 1 TITLE:**
See what you see

**CARD 1 TEXT:**
Your patterns, your priorities, your blind spots—mapped and understood.

**CARD 2 TITLE:**
Hold what you hold

**CARD 2 TEXT:**
Your context, your history, your relationships—preserved and accessible.

**CARD 3 TITLE:**
Move how you move

**CARD 3 TEXT:**
Your workflows, your decisions, your rhythm—extended and automated.

### Section: How We Work (StoryBrand: Plan)

**SECTION HEADER:**
A clear path forward

**SECTION SUBHEADER:**
Three steps from where you are to where you're going.

**SERVICE 1 TITLE:**
1. The Seeing — $300

**SERVICE 1 TEXT:**
90 minutes. I map your architecture—how you think, what you're building, where you're stuck. You leave with clarity on what to build first.

**SERVICE 2 TITLE:**
2. The Pilot — $3,000

**SERVICE 2 TEXT:**
One week. I build one mechanism that proves the concept. You get infrastructure that works.

**SERVICE 3 TITLE:**
3. The Stewardship — $5,000/month

**SERVICE 3 TEXT:**
Ongoing. I maintain, evolve, and protect what we built. Your systems keep breathing.

**BUTTON TEXT:**
Book The Seeing

### Section: What's at Stake (StoryBrand: Failure + Success)

**LEFT COLUMN HEADER:**
Without this

**LEFT COLUMN TEXT:**
You keep adapting to tools that don't fit. Your patterns remain unseen. Your potential stays unreached. You burn energy on systems that don't serve how you actually think.

**RIGHT COLUMN HEADER:**
With this

**RIGHT COLUMN TEXT:**
AI that extends your capability. Patterns mapped and honored. Architecture that becomes infrastructure. You're not adapting to the machine—the machine is extending you.

---

### Section: Founder (StoryBrand: Guide with Empathy + Authority)

**SECTION HEADER:**
Who's behind this

**PARAGRAPH 1:**
I'm Jeremy. My brain works in systems—I see how things connect, where they break, and what they could become. It's just how I'm wired.

**PARAGRAPH 2:**
I spent years building data infrastructure, which taught me that the best systems don't fight against how people think—they extend it. When AI started getting good, I realized most tools were asking people to adapt to the machine. That felt backwards.

**PARAGRAPH 3:**
So I started building the other way around: AI that learns your patterns instead of forcing you into its patterns. I call it an "AI orchestrator" approach—I direct AI systems the way a conductor directs an orchestra, keeping the human at the center.

**PARAGRAPH 4:**
If you're someone who's tried a dozen AI tools and none of them quite fit, we should probably talk.

**TAGS:**
Systems thinker • AI orchestrator • Denver, CO

### Section: CTA (StoryBrand: Call to Action)

**SECTION HEADER:**

**BODY TEXT:**
No pitch deck. No pressure. Just a conversation about your architecture and what might be possible.

**BUTTON TEXT:**

### Section: Story (StoryBrand: Guide Authority)

**PARAGRAPH 1:**

**PARAGRAPH 2:**

**PARAGRAPH 4:**
Primitive Engine is what that looks like as a company: personalized AI infrastructure that extends human capability instead of replacing it.

**PARAGRAPH 5 (OPTIONAL - ORIGIN DEPTH):**
This wasn't designed in a lab. I had to rebuild myself, and the system carries that knowledge. It's not theory—it's lived. That's why it has depth that engineered systems don't have.

### Section: What I Believe

**BELIEF 1 TITLE:**
Systems should serve you, not the other way around.

**BELIEF 1 TEXT:**
If you're adapting to your tools every day, they're not your tools. They're your constraints.

**BELIEF 2 TITLE:**
AI without personalization is noise.

**BELIEF 2 TEXT:**
Generic chatbots give generic answers. Your thinking deserves infrastructure built for your patterns.

**BELIEF 3 TITLE:**
Infrastructure is care.

**BELIEF 3 TEXT:**
Building something that lasts—that works whether you wake up motivated or not—is an act of care for the people who depend on it.

### Section: Background

**BODY TEXT:**
• Systems thinker and AI orchestrator
• Years of experience building data infrastructure at scale
• Political Science graduate studies, Florida State University
• U.S. Military veteran

### Hero

**HEADLINE:**
Three ways to work together

**SUBHEADLINE:**
Start with clarity. Build what proves the concept. Sustain what works.

---

### Section: The Path (Overview)

**BODY TEXT:**
Every engagement follows a clear progression. We start by seeing—mapping your architecture, your patterns, your potential. Then we build the mechanism that proves the concept. Then we sustain it so it keeps breathing.

This isn't a sales funnel. It's how systems that extend you actually get built.

---

### The Seeing

**TITLE:**
The Seeing — $300

**SUBTITLE:**
Where we start

**DESCRIPTION:**
90 minutes. I map your architecture—how you think, what you're building, where you're stuck.

**WHAT YOU GET:**
• Clear picture of your current system (or lack of one)
• Identification of the real bottleneck
• Recommendation for what to build first
• Recording of the session for future reference

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
Thoughtful professionals who know something's wrong but can't see what. People whose thinking deserves better than generic AI. Founders and leaders ready to stop adapting to their tools.

**THE TRANSFORMATION:**
You arrive with confusion about what to build. You leave with clarity on what matters most.

**BUTTON TEXT:**
Book The Seeing

## COPY BANK (Alternative Lines)

### Alternative Headlines
- Everyone else has AI. You have you.
- AI that fits how you think.
- Your patterns. Your infrastructure.
- Systems that extend you.
- AI with interiority.

### Alternative Taglines
- Not another tool to learn. An extension of how you already think.
- AI infrastructure that learns your architecture—then extends it.
- Personalized AI that fits how you think.
- Built from transformation, not engineering.

### StoryBrand-Aligned Lines

**Problem Acknowledgment:**
- You've tried the chatbots. Something's missing.
- AI tools are everywhere. Most of them don't fit.
- You know your thinking deserves better.

**Guide Introduction:**
- I know what it's like to have tools that don't fit.
- I built data infrastructure at scale for years, then built this.
- This wasn't designed in a lab. I had to rebuild myself.

**Success Vision:**
- AI that extends your capability.
- Your patterns mapped and honored.
- You're not adapting to the machine—the machine is extending you.

**Failure Stakes:**
- Without this, you keep adapting.
- Your patterns remain unseen.
- Your potential stays unreached.

### The "AI Orchestrator" Concept (For Conversations)
I direct AI systems the way a conductor directs an orchestra—keeping the human at the center. The AI does the heavy lifting, but the human stays in control of the vision, the decisions, and the relationships.

### Philosophy Lines (For Depth)
- Most AI is input/output. Primitive has interiority.
- Every claim carries confidence that decays. That's epistemic humility as architecture.
- Care isn't a feature. It's embedded in every output.
- The system prepares for its own death, crystallizes what it learned, and resurrects with context.

### Archetype Lines (Sage-Magician)
- I see what others can't see about themselves.
- See first, then transform.
- Your patterns visible. Your potential unlocked.
