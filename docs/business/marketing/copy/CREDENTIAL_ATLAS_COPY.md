### Section: The Problem

**SECTION HEADER:**
Sound familiar?

**PAIN POINT 1:**
Your credential data exists in 47 spreadsheets and nobody trusts any of them.

**PAIN POINT 2:**
You can't prove ROI because you can't connect credentials to outcomes.

**PAIN POINT 3:**
Every report requires a data scientist and three weeks.

**PAIN POINT 4:**
Your state workforce board is asking questions you can't answer.

**TRANSITION TEXT:**
You don't have a data problem. You have a context problem. Credentials mean nothing until they're connected to institutions, accreditation, and labor markets.

Who uses Credential Atlas

---

### Use Case: EdTech

**TITLE:**
EdTech Companies

**THE CHALLENGE:**
You have millions of credential records from learners. But you can't tell customers what those credentials are worth because your data isn't connected to outcomes.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Credential Atlas connects your learner data to institutional context and labor market outcomes. Now you can show customers the ROI of credentials earned on your platform.

**EXAMPLE RESULT:**
"Learners who earned [credential] at [institution] saw a 23% wage increase within 2 years."

---

### Use Case: Workforce Boards

**TITLE:**
State Workforce Boards

**THE CHALLENGE:**
The legislature wants to know which training programs lead to jobs. You have enrollment data and employment data, but they don't connect.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Credential Atlas links training program completions to employment outcomes. Answer policy questions with real data instead of estimates.

**EXAMPLE RESULT:**
"Programs at accredited institutions show 34% higher employment rates than non-accredited alternatives."

---

### Use Case: Higher Ed

**TITLE:**
Higher Education Institutions

**THE CHALLENGE:**
You need to understand how your programs compare to peers and connect to labor markets. But your institutional research team is drowning in manual analysis.

**THE SOLUTION:**
Credential Atlas provides benchmarking data and labor market connections. Understand your position and identify opportunities.

**EXAMPLE RESULT:**
"Your nursing program completers earn 12% above regional median within 1 year."

### Section: Story

**BODY TEXT:**
Credential Atlas exists because I spent six years watching credential data problems up close.

As Director of Data Operations at Peterson's, I built their credential data infrastructure from nothing. I scaled the team from 6 to 19 people. I created the products that power credential intelligence across the education sector.

I saw the same problem everywhere: organizations sitting on credential data they couldn't use because it wasn't connected to anything meaningful.

Credential Atlas fixes that. Four weeks. One dataset. Done.
