# Truth Forge Website Plan — Truth Engine Only

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Scope:** This website covers **Truth Forge / Truth Engine services only.**  
**Source of truth:** [docs/business/plans/TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md](../plans/TRUTH_ENGINE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md)

---

## 1. Scope

**Truth Forge** (Truth Engine LLC) sells NOT-ME's — sovereign AI on hardware you own.  
Primitive Engine and Credential Atlas are **not** presented on this site.  
"Beyond Truth Engine" (architecture, certification) is out of scope for the website.

---

## 2. Core Messaging (from Plan)

- **One-sentence:** One person. One NOT-ME. One year. Truth Engine sells the hardware (and optional annual service). The NOT-ME takes a year to know you.
- **What we are:** A cognitive architecture company. A NOT-ME factory. Not a hardware company, cloud company, or model company — we use Apple, Google, Llama. **We make minds.**
- **What we sell:** Four tiers — DRUMMER (Presence), SOLDIER (Companion), KING (Partner), EMPIRE (You). One-time hardware purchase. **No subscription required.** Optional annual service.
- **What we became:** The first to make sovereign AI accessible — under $10k, on Apple hardware, that you **own**. Not generic AI, not enterprise AI on their servers.
