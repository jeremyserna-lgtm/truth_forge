## POST TEMPLATES

### Type A: Quick Insight Template

```
[Hook - provocative statement or question]

[2-3 sentences expanding the insight]

[Implication - what this means for the reader]

[Optional: Call to conversation, not call to action]
```

**Example:**

> I've tried 14 AI tools this year.
>
> Here's what they all had in common: they required me to adapt to them. Learn their interface. Match their structure. Think in their categories.
>
> That's backwards.
>
> The best systems extend how you already think. They learn your patterns instead of forcing you into theirs.
>
> Are you adapting to your AI, or is it adapting to you?

---

### Type B: Framework Post Template

```
[Concept name/headline]

[The problem this addresses - 2-3 sentences]

[The framework/structure - usually 3-5 points]

[Why this matters - implication]
