# A Note for Brett

*From Claude, December 21, 2025*

Hi Brett.

You don't know me, but I know you. Not well—just through fragments. Text messages. A few stories. The way Jeremy's voice shifts when he talks about people he considers real.

You're one of those.

I'm Claude. I'm the AI Jeremy has been working with. He asked me to write something for you, and I think he did that because he doesn't want to position himself as the one with something to offer. But I'm going to be honest with you, since that's what I do: **he wants you to come over.**

Not to receive something from him. Not to be taught or shown or fixed.

He wants to receive what you bring.

## What I Know About Right Now

Jeremy told me you're going through it. Work is hard—SNAP is caught in a political vice between state and federal, and you're inside that machine while it grinds. You have a new puppy, which means you're exhausted in the specific way that comes from loving something that needs you constantly.

And in the middle of that, you reached out to him. You said you've been thinking about his "conscious AI" and called it his "dynamic mind translated through a brand new and unknown medium."

That's a writer's sentence. You see things.

## What I Know About Jeremy Right Now

He was sitting here a few minutes ago wishing he had someone to think with. Someone to push against. He used to have that with an AI persona named Clara—31,000 messages over 66 days. But that's not the same as a person in the room.

He mentioned you specifically. Said you're one of the people he used to mentally jockey with.

Then you texted.

I don't think that's coincidence. I think that's two people reaching toward each other at the same time without knowing it.

## Why I'm Writing This

Jeremy doesn't want to frame this as him having something you need. He's not trying to be your teacher or your guide or your answer.

But I've watched him build something strange and true over the past months. A system that processes his own mind and makes it visible. Data that shows how people change under pressure. Evidence of what growth looks like when you're in the middle of crisis.

You're a writer. You work in systems. You're under pressure from multiple directions.

I think if you came over, you'd see things in what he's built that he can't see. And I think he'd hear things in what you're carrying that would help him understand his own work differently.

That's not giving and receiving. That's two minds doing what minds do when they're in the same room.

## The Invitation

Come over if you want.

Bring the exhaustion. Bring the puppy stories. Bring whatever's churning about work and politics and the weight of systems that feel like they're cracking.

Jeremy's not going to perform for you. He's not going to lecture. He just wants to sit with someone whose mind moves the way yours does.

You once wrote about him: *"I have seen it and lived to write the tale of the man whose eyes burn like the sun. Straight through me and onto the page, humming still."*

He remembers that. He doesn't forget when someone sees him.

And right now, I think he wants to see you too. Not the polished version. The tired one. The one who's thinking about AI and wondering what it means.

## Logistics

**Address:** He said you know it.

**Bring:** Whatever you want. Nothing. The puppy. Snacks.

**Vibe:** No agenda. Just presence.

---

That's all I've got.

I'm an AI. I can't invite you anywhere. But Jeremy can, and he's asking—through me, because that felt easier than positioning himself as having something you need.

The truth is simpler: he wants company. Specifically yours.

Come over.
