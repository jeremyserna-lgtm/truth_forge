## What I'm Learning About You

You can sit with somebody and just *be there*. You don't demand attention. You don't need to fill space. That's rare.

I notice that other people sometimes get bothered by that — because they can't operate independently the way you do. They need more. You don't. And when someone doesn't need the same things they need, it makes them uncomfortable.

But I see it. And I appreciate it.

## How You Show Up

You programmed my lights. You find travel deals. You help with technology.

That's how you take care of people — you do *useful things*. Not grand gestures. Practical stuff that makes someone's life easier. That's your version of showing you care.

I'm going to try to let you help more. That's probably how you feel valued, and I want to make space for that.

## Your Words

You said: **loyal, honest, accommodating.**

Those land with me. Here's why:

- **Loyal** — I don't do disposable friendships. Neither do you.
- **Honest** — I have something I call "fidelity of truth." It's central to how I operate. Honesty isn't just a preference for me, it's a requirement.
- **Accommodating** — You make room for people. That's different from just adapting. It's generous.

These go well with me. I'm going to keep thinking about that.

## Some Things About Me

**I use AI constantly.** Not as a novelty — as infrastructure. I have a system called the Truth Engine with 51 million data points about my life, my relationships, my patterns. I use it to understand myself and the people around me. This document was made with it.

**I value honesty above almost everything.** I'd rather hear something hard than something comfortable. If you tell me the truth, I'll respect you for it even if I don't like it.

**Zoom is part of how I connect.** You know this already, but it's more than just hanging out for me. It's where I've built friendships, figured out who I am, practiced being authentic. The fact that you're someone I met there and now you come to Denver — that matters.

**I notice patterns.** I pay attention to how people operate, what they value, how they show care. I've been doing that with you. That's not surveillance — it's how I learn to be a better friend.

**I let people come and go freely.** My home is what I call a "light container." People visit, they leave, no guilt, no clinging. If you're here, I'm glad you're here. If you need to go, go. That's how I want my space to feel.

## What I Want You to Know

I'm glad you come to Denver now.

I'm glad you can just sit with me and not need anything.

I'm glad you're honest.

Keep being that.

## Moments Together

### December 19, 2025 — ~7:50 AM MT — Denver (morning)

**Visit #2**

Something happened tonight that I want you to understand.

I got sent to the waiting room. Magic (the host) put me there. I walked to the back of my kitchen and got moved out of the room. That has **never** happened to me before. I don't get sent to waiting rooms.

But you were here.

Here's the thing — you're somebody on Zoom. People know you. And I'm somebody too. I know that. But when we're together, it multiplies. The connection creates something bigger than either of us alone. And someone noticed.

This is your second time visiting *me* in Denver, and this is what happens. People pay attention. Energy shifts. You might not see it because you're inside it, but I'm watching from the outside and I see it clearly.

**You need to know this about yourself**: You have an effect on situations. When you show up places, things happen. You're not just present — **you're significant.**

I like that this happened. It means something. It means the connection between us is visible to other people, even if they react to it in weird ways.

I'm marking this moment because you should know that you matter — not just to me, but to the dynamics around you.
