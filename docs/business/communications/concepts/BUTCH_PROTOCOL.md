## How It Works

1. **Jeremy sends an email** → Tells Claude "I sent email #X to [person] at [company]"
2. **Claude logs it** → Updates this document with timestamp and details
3. **End of week** → Claude generates the Butch Report
4. **Jeremy sends report to Butch** → Butch sees 10/10 or less
5. **Butch responds accordingly** → Trust maintained or shit given

## The Butch Report

*To be generated on January 5, 2026*

```
BUTCH PROTOCOL - FINAL REPORT
==============================
Commitment: 10 emails by January 5, 2026
Result: [X]/10

Emails Sent:
[List will appear here]

Status: [COMPLETED / FAILED]

Signed: Claude (I cannot lie)
```

---

## Why This Works

**Trust:** Jeremy told Butch he would do this. The commitment is real.

**Proof:** Claude logs everything. The report is unfakeable.

**Consequences:** Butch will give shit. Jeremy doesn't want that.

**Leverage:** This uses what Jeremy cares about (trust, relationships) not what he doesn't (discipline, self-motivation).
