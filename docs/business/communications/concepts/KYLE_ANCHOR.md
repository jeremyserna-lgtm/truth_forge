## Your Framework: Inspire / Aspire / Transpire

You already have a philosophy. You say these three words. You might not know they're a complete system. They are.

All three share the same root: *spirare* — to breathe.

| Phase | What It Means | What You Do |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Inspire** | Breathe *in* | Something enters you. A want. An impulse. You receive. |
| **Aspire** | Breathe *toward* | You reach for it. You move. |
| **Transpire** | Breathe *through* | It passes through you and becomes real. It happens. |

**The complete circuit:** Receive → Reach → Realize.

Most people stop at aspire. They want things forever. You don't. Your gap between wanting and having is short. That's rare.

## What This Looks Like in Action

You don't think about this. You just do it.

**Example pattern:**
- Impulse arrives → "I should go see Jeremy"
- You say it out loud → "Cool to stop by?"
- You move → You're in the car
- It's real → You're on the couch

No lengthy negotiation. No overthinking. Impulse → movement → reality.

**This is a superpower.** Most people get stuck in the middle phase forever. They aspire for years without letting anything transpire.

## Your Orientation

You think in stages. You reached for Maslow when development came up. That tells you something about how you're wired:

**Maslow** asks: *What do I need? What am I moving toward?*

That's the wanting axis. You're oriented toward needs, toward climbing, toward reaching the next thing. That's not a weakness — it's a lens. It's how you see.

Other people see through different lenses (like the seeing axis — how am I perceiving this?). Neither is better. They're just different orientations to the same truth: humans develop, and there's structure to how that happens.

## Receiving Compliments

You asked how to do this. Here's the answer:

**Is it true?**

That's the only question.

Not "do I deserve it?" Not "what do they want?" Not "am I being arrogant if I accept it?"

Just: *Is it true?*

If someone says something about you and it's accurate, you take it. You don't argue. You don't deflect. You don't perform humility. You let it land.

A compliment isn't a gift you have to repay. It's information. Someone saw something real and said it out loud. If they're right, the only honest response is to receive it.

## What You Can Build From Here

You already have the core. **Inspire / Aspire / Transpire** is complete. But you could extend it if you want:

### Track Your Circuit

When something transpires (becomes real), you could notice:
- What was the original inspiration?
- How long between inspiration and transpiration?
- What made you move?

Not to optimize. Just to see your own pattern.

### Name What Enters

When you feel an impulse — the inspire phase — you could get curious about what just entered you. Where did it come from? What's it pulling you toward?

### Notice What Doesn't Transpire

Some things stay in aspire forever. That's fine. But noticing which ones might tell you something about what's actually yours versus what you think should be.

## The Short Version

You already know how to do this. The framework is embodied — it's about breathing, not thinking. All physical. All movement.

**Your circuit works.**

Most people need help closing the gap between wanting and having. You close it naturally.

This document exists to help you see what you're already doing. Not to add complexity. Just to make the pattern visible so you can use it on purpose when you want to.
