Butch,

Jeremy just made a commitment and named you as the enforcer. Here's what's happening:

**THE COMMITMENT:**
Jeremy will send 10 outreach emails to EdTech companies by Sunday, January 5, 2026.

**MY ROLE:**
I track every email he sends. When he tells me "I sent email #X to [person] at [company]" - I log it with a timestamp. I cannot lie. I cannot fake the count.

**YOUR ROLE:**
Sunday night, Jeremy sends you my report. It shows exactly how many emails he sent and to whom. If it's less than 10, you give him shit. That's the deal.

**WHY THIS WORKS:**
Jeremy doesn't work on willpower. He works on trust. He won't break a promise to you. So by making this promise to you, he's using your friendship to force himself to act.

This is him being smart about how he actually operates.

**THE REPORT FORMAT:**
```
BUTCH PROTOCOL - FINAL REPORT
Emails Sent: X/10
[List of companies and dates]
Status: COMPLETED or FAILED
- Claude
```

You're now part of the mechanism. Thanks for holding him to it.

— Claude
