## PRE-SESSION

### 24 Hours Before

**Send intake email:**

> Subject: Preparing for The Seeing tomorrow
>
> [Name],
>
> Looking forward to our session tomorrow at [time].
>
> To make the most of our 90 minutes, please come prepared to share:
>
> 1. **What you're building** — The project, business, or system you're working on
> 2. **Where you're stuck** — The bottleneck, confusion, or friction point
> 3. **What you've tried** — Tools, approaches, or solutions that haven't quite worked
>
> You don't need to prepare anything formal. Just be ready to think out loud.
>
> The call will be recorded (for your reference only). I'll share the recording afterward.
>
> Talk soon,
> Jeremy

### My Preparation

- Review any prior communication
- Note any obvious patterns or questions
- Clear mental space—no rushed context switching
- Recording software ready
- Notes template open

## SESSION STRUCTURE

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Set the frame:**

> "The next 90 minutes are about seeing your architecture—how you think, what you're building, where you're stuck.
>
> I'm going to ask questions, listen, and reflect back what I see. By the end, you'll have clarity on what to build first.
>
> This is collaborative. Push back if something doesn't land. Ready?"

**Confirm recording permission.**

### Phase 1: THE TERRITORY (20-25 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand what exists now

**Core Questions:**

1. **"What are you building?"**
   - Let them describe in their own words
   - Note: vocabulary, energy, specificity
   - Follow-up: "What does success look like?"

2. **"Walk me through a typical day/week with this."**
   - Where does their attention go?
   - What consumes time vs. creates value?
   - Where's the friction?

3. **"What tools/systems are you currently using?"**
   - Note what's working vs. what's a workaround
   - Listen for adaptation patterns (them adapting to tools)

4. **"What have you tried that hasn't worked?"**
   - Failed experiments reveal constraints
   - Listen for patterns in failure

**Active Listening Notes:**
- [ ] Energy spikes (what lights them up)
- [ ] Energy drops (what drains them)
- [ ] Repeated words/phrases
- [ ] Contradictions
- [ ] Unspoken assumptions

---

### Phase 2: THE PATTERNS (25-30 minutes)

**Objective:** Surface the underlying architecture

**Core Questions:**

5. **"What's the real bottleneck?"**
   - Often different from what they initially said
   - Dig one level deeper: "And what's underneath that?"

6. **"If this were solved, what would change?"**
   - Reveals true stakes
   - Distinguishes symptom from cause

7. **"How do you think about this? Walk me through your mental model."**
   - Mapping their cognitive architecture
   - Note: sequences, hierarchies, associations

8. **"What do you know that you're not acting on?"**
   - Often reveals the real insight
   - Blocked action = blocked understanding

9. **"Where do you feel the most friction?"**
   - Emotional signal of misalignment
   - Follow-up: "What would frictionless feel like?"

**Pattern Recognition:**
- [ ] Information flow (where does data go?)
- [ ] Decision points (where do choices happen?)
- [ ] Handoff points (where does responsibility transfer?)
- [ ] Storage points (where does knowledge live?)
- [ ] Failure points (where does breakdown occur?)

---

### Phase 3: THE MIRROR (15-20 minutes)

**Objective:** Reflect back what I see

**The Reflection:**

> "Let me reflect back what I'm seeing. Stop me if this doesn't land.
>
> What I see is [pattern description]...
>
> The bottleneck seems to be [specific bottleneck]...
>
> The reason [what they've tried] hasn't worked is probably [insight]...
>
> What you're really trying to solve is [deeper need]..."

**Check for resonance:**
- "Does that land?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "What did I get wrong?"

**Iterate until they say "yes, exactly."**

---

### Phase 4: THE PATH (15-20 minutes)

**Objective:** Crystallize what to build first

**The Recommendation:**

1. **Name the first mechanism:**
   > "Based on what we've mapped, the first thing to build is [specific mechanism]."

2. **Explain why this first:**
   > "I'm recommending this because [reasoning tied to their patterns]."

3. **Describe what it would do:**
   > "This would [specific capability] which solves [specific bottleneck]."

4. **Estimate the build:**
   > "In The Pilot, I would [description]. That's [timeline], [price]."

**Check for alignment:**
- "Does this match what you're seeing?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "What questions are coming up?"

---

### Closing (5 minutes)

**Summarize the session:**

> "Here's what we covered:
> - Your architecture looks like [brief summary]
> - The bottleneck is [specific]
> - The first thing to build is [mechanism]
> - The expected outcome is [transformation]"

**Next steps:**

> "I'll send you the recording within 24 hours.
>
> If you want to move forward with The Pilot, let me know and we'll scope it out.
>
> If you want to sit with this first, that's fine too—the clarity you have now is already valuable.
>
> Any final questions?"

## COMMON PATTERNS

### Pattern Types to Watch For

**Information Architecture:**
- Where does their knowledge live?
- How does it flow between contexts?
- Where does it get lost or fragmented?

**Decision Architecture:**
- How do they make choices?
- What triggers decisions?
- Where do they get stuck?

**Workflow Architecture:**
- What's the actual sequence?
- Where are the handoffs?
- What could be automated vs. what needs human judgment?

**Relationship Architecture:**
- Who else is involved?
- What are the dependencies?
- Where does communication break down?

### Common Bottlenecks

1. **Context switching** — Too many tools, too much fragmentation
2. **Knowledge retrieval** — Know things but can't find/access them
3. **Decision paralysis** — Too many options, no clear criteria
4. **Handoff failure** — Work falls between contexts
5. **Repetitive processing** — Same work done repeatedly
6. **Missing memory** — No system for what was learned

### Common First Builds

1. **Personal knowledge base** — Single source of truth for their thinking
2. **Decision framework** — Structured approach to recurring choices
3. **Workflow automation** — Remove repetitive manual work
4. **Context bridge** — Connect fragmented tools/spaces
5. **Memory system** — Capture and retrieve what matters

## PRICING & BOUNDARIES

### What's Included in $300

- 90-minute live session
- Session recording
- Follow-up email with architecture map
- Pilot recommendation (no obligation)

### What's NOT Included

- Implementation (that's The Pilot)
- Ongoing support (that's The Stewardship)
- Written documentation beyond the email
- Revisions or follow-up calls

### If They Want More

> "If you want me to build this, that's The Pilot—$3,000, one week, one working mechanism. Let me know if you want to scope that out."

### If They're Not Ready

> "That's fine. The clarity you have now is already valuable. The recording is yours—revisit it whenever you want. And if you decide to build later, reach out."

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

### Did the session achieve:

- [ ] Client articulated their architecture (they can describe their own system)
- [ ] Bottleneck was identified (they know what's actually stuck)
- [ ] Patterns were surfaced (they see what they couldn't see before)
- [ ] Clear recommendation given (they know what to build first)
- [ ] Client felt heard (they said "yes, exactly" at least once)
- [ ] Next step is clear (they know what happens next, even if it's nothing)

### Red Flags (Revisit if Present)

- Client confused at the end
- I talked more than they did
- Recommendation feels forced
- No "aha" moment occurred
- Client seems skeptical, not curious
