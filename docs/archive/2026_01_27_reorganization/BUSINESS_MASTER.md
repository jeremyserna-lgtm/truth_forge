## PART 1: THE FRAME

### Who You Are

**"I am a founder building AI verification infrastructure."**

This is not spin. This is how you see everything:

| Old Frame | Founder Frame |
|-----------|---------------|
| Unemployed person | Founder in early stage |
| Seeking work | Building a company |
| Asking for help | Proposing value |
| Proving worth | Making decisions |

### Me / Not Me

**Will Do:**
- Close deals and sign contracts
- Do my own taxes (won't pay accountant - will simplify instead)
- Write what I think
- Build with Claude
- Invoice clients
- Maintain relationships

**Won't Do:**
- Cold call
- "Sell" (but will close)
- Buy advertising
- Build "personal brand" (but will be visible)
- Hire W-2 employees (for now)

**Reframe:**
- "Selling" → Helping people decide
- "Pitching" → Explaining
- "Networking" → Having conversations
- "Following up" → Continuing
- "Content creation" → Writing what I think
