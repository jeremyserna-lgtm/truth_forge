# Planning Layer

**What planning primitives ARE.**

---

## Why This Layer Exists

Plans are promises made visible. Before building, we must think. This layer defines the craft of thinking clearly enough to write down what we intend.

---

## What A Planning Primitive IS

A planning primitive is a **single aspect of intentional design** that ensures work is understood before begun.

Planning primitives are:
- **Forward-looking**: Defines what WILL be, not what IS
- **Decision-capturing**: Records choices and tradeoffs
- **Scope-bounded**: Has clear boundaries and completion criteria

Planning primitives are NOT:
- Documentation (that describes what IS)
- Status reports (that describe what WAS)
- Backlogs (that describe what MIGHT be)

---

## The Intention Principle

A plan without clear intention is a wish list. Planning primitives ensure that before code is written, someone has thought clearly about what it should do and why.

---

## How Primitives Relate

Planning primitives form a design thinking system:

```
Strategy             │  Tracking
────────────────────────────────────
PLANS                │  STATUS
(what we'll build)   │  (where we are)
DECISIONS            │  COMPLETION
(why this way)       │  (are we done?)
```

Strategy defines WHAT and WHY. Tracking defines WHERE we are.
