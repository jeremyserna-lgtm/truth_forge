## What a Validation primitive IS

A Validation primitive is a **gate that confirms a service is correct from multiple perspectives**. It goes beyond code-level testing to answer holistic questions: Does it work? Does it provide the intended value? Is it secure? Is it robust?

This standard exists to provide the formal definition of "DONE" for a service. It is the final quality check that ensures the `TRUTH` of the code, the `MEANING` of the product, and the `CARE` of the implementation all align before a service becomes `ACTIVE`.

## Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **UAT.md** | User Acceptance Testing: Validates the product value for `THE OTHER`. |
| **PERFORMANCE.md**| Performance & Load Testing: Validates the service's stability. |
| **SECURITY.md**| Security Audits: Validates the service's defenses. |
| **FIDELITY.md**| Fidelity Checks: Validates alignment with framework principles. |
