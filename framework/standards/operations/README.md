## What an Operations primitive IS

An Operations primitive is a **standard for the care and feeding of a live, running service**. While `code_quality/` governs the static code, `operations/` governs the dynamic, living system.

This standard exists to honor the "Protocol of Dual Reality" from `01_IDENTITY.md`. `ME` sleeps. The service (`NOT-ME`) must run continuously, reliably, and cost-effectively. These standards are the architectural patterns that provide `CARE` to the running system, so `ME` doesn't have to carry the burden manually.

## Primitives

| Primitive | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **DEPLOYMENT.md**| How services are built and released. |
| **OBSERVABILITY.md**| How we see inside a running service (logging, metrics). |
| **COST_MANAGEMENT.md**| How we track and control the financial cost of a service. |
| **INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md**| How we respond when a service fails. |
