# Document Layer

**What document primitives ARE.**

---

## Why This Layer Exists

Documents are the universal primitive. Every piece of knowledge, every standard, every communication exists as a document. This layer defines the craft of document creation itself.

---

## What A Document Primitive IS

A document primitive is a **single aspect of document craft** that applies to all documents regardless of content.

Document primitives are:
- **Universal**: Applies to theory docs, meta-standards, and specific standards alike
- **Atomic**: Addresses one concern that cannot be meaningfully split
- **Verifiable**: Can be assessed against any document with clear pass/fail

Document primitives are NOT:
- Content standards (what to write)
- Domain knowledge (what's true about X)
- Format templates (how to style)

---

## The Dual Reader

Every document primitive serves two readers with different constraints:

| Reader | Constraint | Document Primitives Address |
|--------|------------|----------------------------|
| **ME** (Human) | Finite attention, working memory limits | LENGTH, STRUCTURE |
| **NOT-ME** (AI) | Context window, token costs | LENGTH, ANCHOR |
| **OTHER** (Consumer) | Discoverability, navigation time | NAVIGATION, LINKS |

A document primitive that serves only one reader is incomplete.

## How Primitives Relate

Document primitives form a complete craft system:

```
Content Boundaries          │  Navigation
─────────────────────────────────────────
LENGTH (how much)          │  NAVIGATION (movement)
ANCHOR (how focused)       │  LINKS (connection)
                           │
Format                     │  Verification
─────────────────────────────────────────
STRUCTURE (shape)          │  COMPLETENESS (coverage)
GRAMMAR (naming)           │
LAYER (placement)          │
```

No primitive is optional. Each addresses a unique concern.

## Assessment Principle

To assess whether a document follows this layer's standards:

1. Check each primitive in INDEX
2. Verify the document satisfies that primitive's requirements
3. A document is complete when ALL primitives pass

The primitives are exhaustive. A document that passes all eight is properly crafted.
