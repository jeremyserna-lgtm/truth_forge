**Every document has ONE link: UP to its INDEX.**

---

## The Rule

Documents link UP to their INDEX. That's it.

```markdown
## UP

[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)
```

---

## Why Only UP

| Old Pattern | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| ALPHA, UP, PREVIOUS, NEXT | Mesh of links, breaks on move |
| Cross-references | Every document knows every document |

| New Pattern | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| UP only | Document knows only its INDEX |
| INDEX handles rest | Coordination through hub |

---

## The Hub Pattern

```
Document → UP → INDEX → UP → Parent INDEX → ... → ALPHA

Documents don't know about each other.
INDEX handles coordination.
```

---

## HOLD:AGENT:HOLD Parallel

```
AGENT doesn't know about other AGENTs.
HOLD handles coordination.

DOCUMENT doesn't know about other DOCUMENTs.
INDEX handles coordination.
```
