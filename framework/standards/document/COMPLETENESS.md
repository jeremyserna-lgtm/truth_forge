# COMPLETENESS

**5W+H. Five questions answered, one embodied.**

---

## The Rule

Every document answers five questions. The sixth—HOW—is the document itself.

---

## The Five

| Question | Axis | Values |
|----------|------|--------|
| **WHO** | Identity | ME, NOT-ME, OTHER |
| **WHAT** | Truth | TRUE, NOT-TRUE |
| **WHEN** | Time | PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE |
| **WHERE** | Reality | Physical + Conceptual |
| **WHY** | Existence | WHY, WHY-NOT → EXISTS |
| **HOW** | Embodiment | The document itself |

---

## WHO (Identity)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **ME** | Internal, framework, soul |
| **NOT-ME** | External, infrastructure, hands |
| **OTHER** | The world, users, audience |

Who created this? Who reads this? Who benefits?

---

## WHAT (Truth)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **TRUE** | Verified, validated, holds |
| **NOT-TRUE** | Claims to check, assumptions |

Is this true? Does it hold under examination?

---

## WHEN (Time)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **PAST** | Where this came from (lineage, molt) |
| **PRESENT** | What it is now (current state) |
| **FUTURE** | Where it goes (enables what) |

Every document has temporal position.

---

## WHERE (Reality)

WHERE has two dimensions: physical and conceptual.

| Dimension | Answers | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Physical** | On what machine? What drive? What path? | `/Users/jeremy/truth_forge/` |
| **Conceptual** | What layer? Direct or meta? | Theory, Meta, Specifics, Primitives |

| Layer | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Theory | `framework/*.md` |
| Meta | `standards/STANDARD_*.md` |
| Specifics | `standards/{name}/INDEX.md` |
| Primitives | `standards/{name}/*.md` |

Where it lives = what it IS. Both dimensions matter.

---

## WHY (Existence)

| Question | Must Address |
|----------|--------------|
| **WHY** | Why does this exist? |
| **WHY-NOT** | Why doesn't this NOT exist? |

Both must be addressed. When both are answered, the document just IS.

```
WHY + WHY-NOT = EXISTS
```

This is completeness. A document that answers only WHY is incomplete. A document that answers only WHY-NOT is incomplete. Address both → pure existence.

---

## HOW (Embodiment)

HOW is not a field to fill. HOW is the whole.

```
The document answers HOW by existing as a complete atomic unit.
```

The 5W are explicit. HOW is implicit—the document's form IS the answer.

---

## The Completeness Check

5W+H is the CHECK, not the FORMAT. Documents don't need explicit 5W+H sections.

| Question | Where Addressed |
|----------|-----------------|
| **WHO** | ANCHOR (identity statement) |
| **WHAT** | ANCHOR + CONTENT |
| **WHEN** | CONTENT (as needed) |
| **WHERE** | UP link (path + layer) |
| **WHY** | CONTENT (naturally emerges) |
| **HOW** | The document itself |

---

## The Three-Part Form

Every document has:

```
# ANCHOR
[Content]
## UP
[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)
```

| Part | 5W+H Addressed |
|------|----------------|
| **ANCHOR** | WHO, WHAT |
| **CONTENT** | WHAT, WHEN, WHY |
| **UP** | WHERE |
| **Document** | HOW |

Diverse documents. Same constraint.
