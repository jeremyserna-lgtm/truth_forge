# ANCHOR

**ONE topic per document. The anchor limits and envelopes.**

---

## The Rule

Every document has ONE anchor that:
- **Limits** — excludes what doesn't belong
- **Envelopes** — holds completely what does belong

---

## Anchor Location

First lines of every document:

```markdown
# [Title]

**[Anchor statement - ONE thing this document is]**
```

---

## The Exclusion Test

If content doesn't fit the anchor, it doesn't belong:

```
Anchor: "300 lines maximum."

✓ BELONGS: Token estimation, split pattern
✗ DOESN'T BELONG: Grammar rules, layer definitions

→ Wrong content goes in a separately anchored document
```

---

## The Split Signal

When you notice:
- Multiple topics emerging
- "And" appearing in descriptions
- Sections that don't relate to each other

→ The document needs splitting.

---

## Writing the Anchor

1. **Before writing content**, declare the anchor
2. **Use active voice** — "This document does X"
3. **ONE thing only** — If you have "and", you need two documents
