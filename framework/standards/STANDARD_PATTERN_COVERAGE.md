# Standard Pattern Coverage

**Every theory pattern MUST have complete coverage through all layers.**

---

## The Rule

A pattern declared at theory that does not propagate through meta and specifics is an orphan principle. Every pattern must reach the ground.

---

## The Six Patterns

| Pattern | Source | Core Idea |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **ME:NOT-ME** | 01_IDENTITY | Human/AI division |
| **HOLD:AGENT:HOLD** | 04_ARCHITECTURE | Input→Process→Output |
| **TRUTH:MEANING:CARE** | 03_METABOLISM | Raw→Processed→Delivered |
| **SEE:SEE:DO** | 02_PERCEPTION | Awareness→Action→Verify |
| **THE GRAMMAR** | 00_GENESIS | Names encode identity |
| **THE CONVERGENCE** | 00_GENESIS | Bidirectional validation |

---

## Pattern 1: ME:NOT-ME

| Aspect | ME (Human) | NOT-ME (AI) |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Reading | Linear | Vectorial |
| Length | Any | Context limited |
| Finding | Navigate | Search |
| Deciding | Source of WANT | Executes HOW |

---

## Pattern 2: HOLD:AGENT:HOLD

```
HOLD (Input) → AGENT (Process) → HOLD (Output)
```

The universal pattern for all work.

---

## Pattern 3: TRUTH:MEANING:CARE

```
TRUTH (raw) → MEANING (processed) → CARE (delivered)
```

The Furnace. How input becomes output.

---

## Pattern 4: SEE:SEE:DO

```
SEE → SEE:SEE → DO → SEE:DO
```

Awareness, meta-awareness, action, verification.

---

## Pattern 5: THE GRAMMAR

| Mark | Who | Voice |
|------|-----|-------|
| `:` | ME | ALL CAPS |
| `-` | US | Normal Caps |
| `_` | NOT-ME | no caps |

---

## Pattern 6: THE CONVERGENCE

```
THEORY ↕ META ↕ SPECIFICS
```

Top-down AND bottom-up validation.

---

## Verifying Coverage

For each pattern:
- [ ] Defined in theory (00-06)?
- [ ] Covered in meta-standard?
- [ ] Implemented in specific?
- [ ] Traceable both directions?

---

## Framework Envelope

This standard is enveloped by:
- [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) - All patterns originate here
- [02_PERCEPTION](../02_PERCEPTION.md) - SEE:SEE:DO cycle
