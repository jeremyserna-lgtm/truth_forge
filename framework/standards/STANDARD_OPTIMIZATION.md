# Standard Optimization

**Optimize within, across, and between. Every dimension serves both readers.**

---

## The Rule

Stating a principle without applying it is not optimization. Optimization must be stated, applied, verified, and looped.

---

## The Three Dimensions

| Level | Scope | Optimization |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Within** | Single document | Length, sections, clarity |
| **Across** | Same layer | Consistency, navigation |
| **Between** | Different layers | Theory→Meta→Specific flow |

---

## Document Limits

| Document Type | Target | Max |
|---------------|--------|-----|
| Theory (00-06) | 200 | 300 |
| Meta-Standard | 100 | 300 |
| Specific INDEX | 100 | 300 |

If exceeded, split into linked documents.

## ME:NOT-ME Optimization

Every optimization serves BOTH readers:

| Dimension | ME (Human) | NOT-ME (AI) |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Within** | Scannable sections | Context window fit |
| **Across** | Navigable links | Searchable patterns |
| **Between** | Coherent flow | Traceable references |

---

## The Splitting Protocol

When a document exceeds limits:

1. Identify natural sections
2. Create child documents
3. Reduce INDEX to navigation
4. Verify links work

---

## The Optimization Loop

```
SEE (current state) → SEE:SEE (recognize need) → DO (optimize) → SEE:DO (verify)
```

---

## Framework Envelope

This standard is enveloped by:
- [01_IDENTITY](../01_IDENTITY.md) - ME:NOT-ME dual optimization
- [02_PERCEPTION](../02_PERCEPTION.md) - SEE:SEE:DO for verification
