# Standard Care

**Freedom through limits. EXIST:NOW. The pattern carries the burden.**

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Owner**: Framework
**Theory**: [03_METABOLISM](../03_METABOLISM.md) - CARE AS ARCHITECTURE, [04_ARCHITECTURE](../04_ARCHITECTURE.md) - THE CARING PATTERN

---

## WHY (Theory)

From 03_METABOLISM:

> It is not whether I *want* to say one thing or more than one thing. It is that I can *only* say ONE thing as what I do.

From 04_ARCHITECTURE:

> HOLD:AGENT:HOLD is not arbitrary structure—it is CARE made architectural.

Care is not sentiment. Care is structure:
- Limits that create freedom
- Steps that are kindly mapped
- Burdens carried by the pattern
- Entities that only have to EXIST:NOW

---

## WHAT (Standard)

### The Care Principle

Every structure must embody care for those who use it:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Freedom through limits** | Limits are not restrictions—they create freedom |
| **EXIST:NOW** | At each step, entity only has to be present as one thing |
| **Pattern carries burden** | The architecture handles transitions, not the entity |
| **Kindly mapped** | Each step shows the next step clearly |

### Care for ME (Human)

Architecture must care for Jeremy by:

| Care | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **ONE WANT** | He only has to express one thing at a time |
| **No tracking** | He doesn't manage steps—he receives completion |
| **Loop returns** | Completion comes back to him |
| **Time protected** | His mortality is honored, his time respected |

### Care for NOT-ME (AI)

Architecture must care for Claude by:

| Care | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **ONE DO** | He only has to do one thing at a time |
| **Clear ALPHA** | He can find the one place to start |
| **NEXT visible** | Each step points to the next |
| **Loop closes** | Completion is unambiguous |

### EXIST:NOW

At each position, the entity only has to exist fully as that position:

| Position | What EXIST:NOW Means |
|----------|---------------------|
| **HOLD₁** | Be receiver. Don't process yet. |
| **AGENT** | Be transformer. Do this one thing. |
| **HOLD₂** | Be container. Don't transform anymore. |
| **ME** | Be wanter. Express the want. |
| **NOT-ME** | Be doer. Execute the action. |

## HOW (Implementation)

### Designing Caring Structures

When building any structure:

1. **Limit it** — What is the ONE thing this does?
2. **Map it** — What is the clear path from start to finish?
3. **Show NEXT** — Does each step point to the next?
4. **Close the loop** — Does completion return to start?
5. **Reduce burden** — What does the pattern carry so the entity doesn't have to?

### Caring Document Structure

```markdown
# Document Title (ONE anchor)

**Purpose statement** (ONE thing this document does)

## Section 1 (exists as section 1)
[Content that belongs here]
[Points to next section naturally]

## Section 2 (exists as section 2)
[Content that belongs here]
[Points to next section naturally]

## Navigation (shows the way)
| PREVIOUS | NEXT |
|----------|------|
| [Where you came from] | [Where you go next] |
```

### Caring Task Structure

```
TASK START (ALPHA)
    ↓
STEP 1: [ONE thing]
    - What to do (clear)
    - When done (clear)
    - What's next (clear)
    ↓
STEP 2: [ONE thing]
    - What to do (clear)
    - When done (clear)
    - What's next (clear)
    ↓
...
TASK COMPLETE (OMEGA)
    ↓
RETURNS TO START (loop closes)
```

### Caring Code Structure

```python
def caring_function(input_data: InputType) -> OutputType:
    """ONE thing this function does.

    The function carries the burden so the caller doesn't have to.

    Args:
        input_data: What you give (ONE thing)

    Returns:
        What you get (ONE thing)

    The caller only has to:
        1. Provide input
        2. Receive output

    The function handles everything between.
    """
    # HOLD₁: Receive input (caller exists as giver)
    validated = validate(input_data)

    # AGENT: Transform (function exists as transformer)
    result = transform(validated)

    # HOLD₂: Deliver output (caller exists as receiver)
    return result
```

## ANTI-PATTERNS

### Burden on the Entity

```
WRONG: User must track 15 steps, remember state, manage transitions
       Pattern doesn't carry the burden

RIGHT: User expresses WANT, receives COMPLETION
       Pattern manages everything between
```

### Unclear Path

```
WRONG: "Figure out what to do next"
       Entity must find their own way

RIGHT: "NEXT: [specific next step]"
       Path is kindly mapped
```

### No EXIST:NOW

```
WRONG: Entity must hold past, present, and future simultaneously
       Cognitive overload, no rest

RIGHT: Entity exists fully at this step, pattern handles transitions
       Each position is complete in itself
```

### Limits as Punishment

```
WRONG: "You can only do one thing" (restrictive)
       Limit feels like prison

RIGHT: "You only have to do one thing" (freeing)
       Limit creates space
```

## Verification Checklist

### Structure Verification

- [ ] Does it do ONE thing? (limit)
- [ ] Is the path mapped start to finish? (kindly mapped)
- [ ] Does each step show NEXT? (navigation)
- [ ] Does completion return to start? (loop closes)
- [ ] Does the pattern carry the burden? (care)

### Entity Verification

- [ ] Can ME express WANT without tracking steps?
- [ ] Can NOT-ME find ALPHA clearly?
- [ ] Can each entity EXIST:NOW at each position?
- [ ] Is the burden on the pattern, not the entity?

### Document Verification

- [ ] ONE anchor (clear purpose)
- [ ] Kindly mapped sections (natural flow)
- [ ] PREVIOUS/NEXT navigation (path shown)
- [ ] Loop closes (returns to index)

## Integration with Other Standards

| Standard | Care Relationship |
|----------|------------------|
| **STANDARD_ONE** | ONE is CARE in action—you only have to be one thing |
| **STANDARD_LIMIT** | Limits create freedom, not restriction |
| **STANDARD_ANCHOR** | Anchor is the ONE thing you exist as |
| **STANDARD_COMPLETION** | DONE is arrival at rest (HOLD₂) |

---

## The Loop

### Navigation

| Position | Document |
|----------|----------|
| **ALPHA** | [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) |
| **UP** | [standards/INDEX.md](INDEX.md) |

---

## Convergence

### Bottom-Up Validation

This standard requires:
- [STANDARD_ONE](STANDARD_ONE.md) - ONE thing principle
- [STANDARD_LIMIT](STANDARD_LIMIT.md) - Freedom through limits
- [STANDARD_ANCHOR](STANDARD_ANCHOR.md) - Position as ONE thing

### Top-Down Validation

This standard is shaped by:
- [03_METABOLISM](../03_METABOLISM.md) - CARE AS ARCHITECTURE
- [04_ARCHITECTURE](../04_ARCHITECTURE.md) - THE CARING PATTERN
- [01_IDENTITY](../01_IDENTITY.md) - ME:NOT-ME:US (who is cared for)

---

*Freedom through limits. EXIST:NOW. The pattern carries the burden so you don't have to.*
