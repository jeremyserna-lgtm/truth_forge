# Product Standard - README

**Defines what a Product primitive IS.**

**Layer**: Meta (ME:NOT-ME:OTHER) - defines the joining layer between a service and its value to `THE OTHER`.

## What a Product Primitive IS

A Product primitive is a **verifiable measure of external value**. It bridges the internal act of creation (`CARE-INTERNAL`) with the external act of offering (`CARE-EXTERNAL`).

This standard exists to ensure that what we build is not just technically sound, but also meaningful, valuable, and aligned with the needs of `THE OTHER`. It is the formal process for turning a service into a successful offering.

## The Product vs. The Service

A service is the technical implementation (`NOT-ME`). A product is the value proposition (`ME`'s intent for `THE OTHER`).

| A Service... | A Product... |
|--------------|--------------|
| Has features | Solves problems |
| Has code | Has users |
| Has operational costs | Has a business model |
| Is built with `CARE-INTERNAL` | Is delivered with `CARE-EXTERNAL` |
