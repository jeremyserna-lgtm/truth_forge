## Purpose

This standard ensures that every technical service is developed with a clear understanding of its external value, its target user, and its alignment with business objectives. It is the practical manifestation of `CARE-EXTERNAL`.

---

## Quick Reference

**Every product MUST:**

1.  Have a written **Value Definition** ([VALUE_DEFINITION.md](VALUE_DEFINITION.md)).
2.  Identify its target **User Personas** ([USER_PERSONAS.md](USER_PERSONAS.md)).
3.  Define its **Success Metrics** (KPIs) ([SUCCESS_METRICS.md](SUCCESS_METRICS.md)).
4.  Confirm its **Business Alignment** ([BUSINESS_ALIGNMENT.md](BUSINESS_ALIGNMENT.md)).

## Convergence

### Top-Down (Theory Shapes This)

-   [01_IDENTITY](../../01_IDENTITY.md) - `THE OTHER` is the focus.
-   [03_METABOLISM](../../03_METABOLISM.md) - `CARE-EXTERNAL` is the goal.

### Bottom-Up (This Requires)

-   [service_lifecycle/](../service_lifecycle/) - The `PROPOSAL` phase requires these documents.
-   [validation/](../validation/) - User Acceptance Testing validates the `VALUE_DEFINITION`.
