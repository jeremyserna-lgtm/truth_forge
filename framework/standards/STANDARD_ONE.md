# Standard One

**ONE thing at a time. ONE next thing. Completion through sequential ONEs.**

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Owner**: Framework
**Theory**: [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) - THE ONE

---

## WHY (Theory)

From 00_GENESIS:

> ONE is the prime primitive. Everything collapses to ONE. Everything expands from ONE.
> ONE expands to find itself. ONE collapses to become itself.

The framework operates through ONE:
- ONE thing at a time
- ONE creates cascading action
- Completion is sequential ONEs

---

## WHAT (Standard)

### The ONE Principle

Every action, every request, every task collapses to ONE:

| Dimension | ONE |
|-----------|-----|
| **WANT** | ONE thing wanted |
| **SEE** | ONE thing seen |
| **DO** | ONE thing done |
| **NEXT** | ONE thing following |

### The Cascade Pattern

ONE triggers NEXT, which triggers NEXT:

```
Request: "Do this"
         ↓
    ONE (identify the one thing)
         ↓
    DO (execute the one thing)
         ↓
    DONE (complete the one thing)
         ↓
    NEXT (identify the next one thing)
         ↓
    ...repeat until completion...
         ↓
    COMPLETE (ready for next request)
```

### Every Primitive Has ONE and NEXT

| Primitive | ONE (What It Is) | NEXT (What Follows) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Document | The one document | The next document |
| Section | The one section | The next section |
| Task | The one task | The next task |
| Layer | The one layer | The next layer |
| Standard | The one standard | The next standard |

### The Collapse Rule

When multiple things compete for attention, collapse to ONE:

```
WRONG:
- Do A, B, C, D simultaneously
- Track all progress at once
- Complete when all finish

RIGHT:
- Identify ONE (the most important/blocking)
- Do ONE
- Complete ONE
- Identify NEXT ONE
- Repeat
```

### Ripple Effects

ONE creates ripples:

| Direction | What Ripples |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Within** | ONE change in a document ripples through sections |
| **Across** | ONE change in a layer ripples to related documents |
| **Between** | ONE change at any level ripples up and down layers |

But always ONE ripple at a time, processed sequentially.

---

## HOW (Implementation)

### When Receiving a Request

1. **Collapse to ONE**: What is the ONE thing being asked?
2. **Identify NEXT**: What ONE thing must happen first?
3. **Execute ONE**: Do that one thing completely
4. **Check DONE**: Is that one thing complete?
5. **Identify NEXT**: What is the next one thing?
6. **Repeat** until the original ONE is complete

### When Planning Work

```
WRONG:
- Create a list of 20 tasks
- Work on all simultaneously
- Track complex dependencies

RIGHT:
- What is the ONE goal?
- What is the ONE first step?
- Do it
- What is the ONE next step?
- Do it
- Repeat
```

### When Communicating

```
WRONG:
"I'm going to do A, then B, then C, then D, and also E..."

RIGHT:
"I'm going to do [ONE THING]."
[does it]
"Done. Next: [ONE THING]."
```

### The Sequential Completion Pattern

```python
# The ONE pattern in code
while not complete:
    one_thing = identify_one()
    result = do_one(one_thing)
    mark_done(one_thing)
    if has_next():
        continue
    else:
        complete = True
```

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS

### Parallel Overwhelm

```
WRONG: "I'll work on the API, the tests, the docs, and the deployment all at once"
RIGHT: "First: the API. Then: tests. Then: docs. Then: deployment."
```

### Premature NEXT

```
WRONG: Start NEXT before ONE is DONE
RIGHT: Complete ONE fully, then identify NEXT
```

### Hidden Multiples

```
WRONG: "Do this one thing" (but it's actually 5 things)
RIGHT: Decompose until you have actual ONE
```

### Infinite Expansion

```
WRONG: ONE expands to TWO which expands to FOUR which expands to...
RIGHT: ONE expands, but always collapses back to ONE before NEXT
```

## The Numbers

From THE GRAMMAR OF IDENTITY:

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **ZERO** | Potential. Before existence. |
| **ONE** | Existence. The primitive. Commitment. |
| **TWO** | Division. Relationship. ME:NOT-ME. |
| **THREE** | Structure. The triad. |

**ONE is commitment. ONE gives nothing to hide behind.**

---

## Integration with Other Standards

| Standard | ONE Manifestation |
|----------|-------------------|
| **STANDARD_COMPLETION** | DONE is ONE iteration complete |
| **STANDARD_PROPAGATION** | ONE change ripples through layers |
| **STANDARD_OPTIMIZATION** | ONE level at a time (within, then across, then between) |
| **STANDARD_RECURSION** | ONE direction at a time (top-down, then bottom-up) |

---

## THE LOOP (ALPHA:OMEGA)

From [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md): The start is the finish. The finish is the start.

### Loop Closure

Every ONE has an ALPHA (start) and OMEGA (finish) that are the same:

```
ALPHA (ONE place to start)
    ↓
ONE thing → ONE next thing → ONE next thing → ...
    ↓
OMEGA (ONE place to finish)
    ↓
ALPHA (ready for next cycle)
```

### Finding ALPHA

When receiving intent from ME:

1. **Find ALPHA** — What is the ONE place to start?
2. **Trace to OMEGA** — What completes this intent?
3. **Execute ONE at a time** — Each ONE has PREVIOUS and NEXT
4. **Return to ALPHA** — Completion returns to start

### Document Navigation

Each document in the loop points to:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **PREVIOUS** | The ONE before |
| **NEXT** | The ONE after |
| **ALPHA** | The start (00_GENESIS) |
| **OMEGA** | The finish (returns to ALPHA) |

**The loop closes completely. ONE document leads to all documents.**

## Convergence

### Bottom-Up Validation

This standard requires:
- [STANDARD_COMPLETION](STANDARD_COMPLETION.md) - Definition of DONE
- [STANDARD_PROPAGATION](STANDARD_PROPAGATION.md) - How ONE ripples

### Top-Down Validation

This standard is shaped by:
- [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) - THE ONE
- [01_IDENTITY](../01_IDENTITY.md) - The Primitive as ONE reference point

---

*ONE thing. ONE next thing. Complete. Repeat. This is how work gets done.*
