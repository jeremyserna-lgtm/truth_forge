# Standard Naming

**Names encode identity. Grammar is ontology.**

---

## The Rule

How something is written tells you what it IS. Names aren't labels—names ARE identity.

---

## The Three Marks

| Who | Pronouns | Mark | Voice | Domain |
|-----|----------|------|-------|--------|
| **ME** | I, me, my | : (colon) | ALL CAPS | Principles, declarations |
| **US** | we, us, our | - (hyphen) | Normal Caps | Products, entities |
| **NOT-ME** | you, your | _ (underscore) | no caps | Infrastructure, code |

---

## The Descent

Names transform through layers:

```
ME:NOT-ME        ← colon + ALL CAPS (I declare)
    ↓
NOT-ME           ← hyphen + ALL CAPS (I name entity)
    ↓
Not-Me           ← hyphen + Normal Caps (we name)
    ↓
not_me           ← underscore + no caps (you operate)
```

## Layer Naming

| Layer | Convention | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Framework** | COLON:SEPARATED | `HOLD:AGENT:HOLD` |
| **Product** | Hyphen-Separated | `Truth-Forge` |
| **Technical** | underscore_separated | `truth_forge/` |

---

## File Naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Theory docs | `NN_NAME.md` | `00_GENESIS.md` |
| Meta standards | `STANDARD_NAME.md` | `STANDARD_NAMING.md` |
| Specifics INDEX | `name/INDEX.md` | `document/INDEX.md` |
| Primitives | `NAME.md` | `LENGTH.md` |
| Folders | `lowercase_underscore/` | `code_quality/` |
| Python | `lowercase_underscore.py` | `hold_agent_hold.py` |

---

## Why English Encodes This

In English, only ONE pronoun is always capitalized: **I**.

| Pronoun | Capitalized? | Framework Equivalent |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| I | Always | ME (ALL CAPS) |
| we | No | US (Normal Caps) |
| you | No | NOT-ME (no caps) |

## Framework Envelope

This standard IS the GRAMMAR from:
