## What a Service Lifecycle primitive IS

A Service Lifecycle primitive is a **defined stage in the life of a service**. The framework governs documents and standards, but services—which are active, running entities—have a more complex journey from idea to retirement.

This standard provides a structured, predictable path for that journey, ensuring that services are proposed, developed, operated, and retired with intention and `CARE`.

## The Lifecycle Stages

A service progresses through a series of formal stages. Unlike the simple `DRAFT → ACTIVE` lifecycle of a document, a service's life includes phases for ideation, operation, and graceful termination.

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **PROPOSAL** | Formalizing an idea and its value proposition. |
| **PROTOTYPE**| Building an experimental version to validate assumptions. |
| **ACTIVE** | A fully supported, production-grade service. |
| **DEPRECATED**| The service is being phased out. |
| **SUNSET** | The service is retired and archived. |
