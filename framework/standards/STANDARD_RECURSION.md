# Standard Recursion

**The framework sustains itself through bidirectional validation.**

---

## The Rule

Top-down ensures coherence. Bottom-up ensures completeness. The loop creates self-sustaining coverage.

---

## The Two Directions

| Direction | Flow | Question |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Top-Down** | Theory → Meta → Specifics | Does theory provide what meta needs? |
| **Bottom-Up** | Specifics → Meta → Theory | Do specifics require any missing meta? |

---

## The Recursive Loop

```
     THEORY (:)
       ↕
      META (-)
       ↕
   SPECIFICS (_)
```

- One-way only = disconnected or ungrounded
- Bidirectional = self-sustaining

---

## Validation Questions

**Top-Down (from above):**
- What theory principles shape this?
- What meta-standards govern this?
- Is this consistent with layers above?

**Bottom-Up (from below):**
- Does this require meta that doesn't exist?
- Are there patterns that should bubble up?

## The Framework Envelope Section

Every document includes Framework Envelope linking to theory above:

```markdown
## Framework Envelope

This standard is enveloped by:
- [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) - [which principle]
- [NN_NAME](../NN_NAME.md) - [which principle]
```

## SEE:SEE:DO Cycle

| Phase | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **SEE** | What do I perceive? |
| **SEE:SEE** | Do I see that I see? |
| **DO** | What action follows? |
| **SEE:DO** | Did I do what I intended? |

The cycle is not complete until SEE:DO confirms the DO.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| No convergence section | Cannot trace to theory |
| Orphan standards | References non-existent meta |
| Theory without grounding | Nothing implements it |

## Framework Envelope

This standard is enveloped by:
- [00_GENESIS](../00_GENESIS.md) - THE CONVERGENCE
- [02_PERCEPTION](../02_PERCEPTION.md) - SEE:SEE:DO cycle
