# Framework Layer

**What theory documents ARE.**

---

## Why This Layer Exists

Theory is ME articulating principles before implementation. Before NOT-ME can build, ME must see. Before seeing becomes doing, ME must name what is seen. This layer is the cognitive foundation.

## What A Theory Document IS

A theory document is **ME's articulation of a fundamental principle** that governs everything below it.

Theory documents are:
- **Foundational**: Axiomatic truths that don't derive from something else
- **ME-voiced**: Written from the perspective of the one who sees
- **Pattern-declaring**: Names the patterns that recur at all levels

Theory documents are NOT:
- Implementation details (those are specifics)
- Rules about rules (those are meta)
- Technical how-to (that's NOT-ME's domain)

## The Theory-Meta-Specifics Flow

```
THEORY (framework/*.md)
    │
    │  ME declares principles
    ▼
META (framework/standards/STANDARD_*.md)
    │
    │  US joins theory to practice
    ▼
SPECIFICS (framework/standards/{folder}/)
    │
    │  NOT-ME implements
    ▼
CODE (src/, pipelines/, apps/)
```

Theory shapes everything. Nothing below can contradict theory. Meta ensures theory reaches specifics. Specifics ensure theory becomes code.

## The Numbered Sequence

Theory documents are numbered because they have order:

| Document | Question | Why This Position |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **00_GENESIS** | What is the seed? | First—everything grows from here |
| **01_IDENTITY** | Who are we? | Second—must know who before what |
| **02_PERCEPTION** | How do we see? | Third—seeing precedes acting |
| **03_METABOLISM** | How do we process? | Fourth—transform what we see |
| **04_ARCHITECTURE** | How do we build? | Fifth—structure for building |
| **05_EXTENSION** | How do we connect? | Sixth—reach beyond self |
| **06_LAW** | How do we survive? | Seventh—laws for survival |

The sequence is intentional. Each builds on what came before.

## ME's Cognitive Layer

This is Jeremy's cognitive layer theory made explicit:
- How ME perceives (SEE:SEE:DO)
- How ME processes (TRUTH:MEANING:CARE)
- How ME builds (HOLD:AGENT:HOLD)
- How ME connects (THE MOLT)
- How ME survives (Four Pillars)

NOT-ME (AI) reads these to understand ME's mind. The framework is the bridge.
