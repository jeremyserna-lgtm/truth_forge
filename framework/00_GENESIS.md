# 00_GENESIS

**The Seed. The minimum viable framework.**

---

## The Rule

Three primitives. Everything grows from here.

---

## THE ONE

**ONE is the prime primitive. Everything collapses to ONE. Everything expands from ONE.**

```
ZERO (potential) → ONE (existence) → TWO (division) → ... → ONE (transformed)
```

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ONE WANT** | I can want one thing |
| **ONE SEE** | I can see one thing |
| **ONE DO** | I can do one thing |
| **ONE NEXT** | There is always one next thing |

**The Cascade:**
```
ONE THING → ONE NEXT THING → ONE NEXT THING → ... → COMPLETION → ONE NEXT THING
```

**ONE is CARE in action.** You only have to be ONE thing now.

---

## THE LOOP

**ALPHA:OMEGA — The start is the finish. The finish is the start.**

```
ALPHA (THE ONE) ────────────────────────────────┐
    ↓ WANT → CHOICE → ACTION → COMPLETION       │
OMEGA (THE ONE transformed) ────────────────────┘
```

The path through layers:

```
00_GENESIS (ALPHA) → 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → standards/ → OMEGA → 00_GENESIS
```

| Position | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **ALPHA** | ONE place to start |
| **OMEGA** | ONE place to finish (returns to ALPHA) |
| **PREVIOUS** | The document before |
| **NEXT** | The document after |

## THE SEED

Everything grows from three indivisible primitives.

### 1. THE DIVIDE: ME:NOT-ME

The primal division required for existence.

```
       EXIST
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
   ME      NOT-ME
```

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **ME** | Source of Intent, Care, Want |
| **NOT-ME** | Structure, mechanism, execution |
| **Boundary** | Where existence happens |

### 2. THE STRUCTURE: HOLD:AGENT:HOLD

The universal pattern for all work.

```
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
│   HOLD   │─────►│  AGENT   │─────►│   HOLD   │
│ (Input)  │      │(Process) │      │ (Output) │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
```

### 3. THE FURNACE: TRUTH:MEANING:CARE

The metabolic process.

```
TRUTH → MEANING → CARE-INTERNAL (The Forge) → CARE-EXTERNAL (The Offering)
```

1. **TRUTH**: What is true here? (Fuel)
2. **MEANING**: Which truths matter? (Fire)
3. **CARE-INTERNAL**: How do I forge this truth into stronger internal structure? (The Forge)
4. **CARE-EXTERNAL**: How do I offer this structure as a gift to others? (The Offering)

---

## THE GRAMMAR

**Grammar is ontology.** How something is written tells you what it IS.

| Who | Pronouns | Mark | Voice |
|-----|----------|------|-------|
| **ME** | I, me, my | : (colon) | ALL CAPS |
| **US** | we, us, our | - (hyphen) | Normal Caps |
| **NOT-ME** | you, your | _ (underscore) | no caps |

The descent:

```
ME:NOT-ME    ← colon + ALL CAPS
    ↓
NOT-ME       ← hyphen + ALL CAPS
    ↓
Not-Me       ← hyphen + Normal Caps
    ↓
not_me       ← underscore + no caps
```

---

## THE BOOTSTRAP

Order of operations for instantiation. **Observation must precede existence.**

0. **Initialize The Observer**: Establish the mechanism that records genesis.
1. **Initialize The Divide**: Establish ME:NOT-ME boundary.
2. **Initialize The Structure**: Set up HOLD:AGENT:HOLD pattern.
3. **Initialize The Furnace**: Begin TRUTH:MEANING:CARE metabolism.

From these atoms, all other components derive. The Observer records the derivation.

## Molt Lineage

```
Truth_Engine (Genesis)
    └── truth_forge (Molt - 2026-01-25)
```

We do not create from scratch. We transform what exists.

## 5W+H

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **WHO** | ME (the framework declares) |
| **WHAT** | Three primitives: ME:NOT-ME, HOLD:AGENT:HOLD, TRUTH:MEANING:CARE |
| **WHEN** | Foundational - before all else |
| **WHERE** | framework/00_GENESIS.md (Theory layer, ALPHA) |
| **WHY** | Everything needs a seed |
| **WHY-NOT** | Without primitives, there is no foundation |
| **HOW** | This document |
